True indeed, I love most (if not all) of Apple products. But, I wasn’t born like this. There is some short story before I come to get know Apple products.</p><!--more--><p>I remembered back then 2 years ago when I first started to learn about computer. Everything was fascinating, I was given the chance to use notebook in the office at night since I didn’t have my own. And during that time, I only knew that computer is Windows.</p><p>So, I learned my way around Windows. I used a lot of software to optimise Windows. Windows XP was still in its glory era. I even got myself a handbook to tweak the registry just to increase the performance. And it was likely several times the notebook need to be formatted.</p><p>And… something amazing happened…</p><p>One of my friend brought his shiny elegant MacBook White to our class. I was really fascinated. It was really the first time I could actually see and use it. And the first question from me was “How much does it cost?”. For someone like me who were just a normal college student with no income, moreover living in Indonesia. Buying MacBook was my first goal that I must achieve. And the MacBook White during that time is around 13 million rupiah or around 1400 USD.</p><p>MacBook back then was a very expensive product and only some people were able to purchase one. Geeks like me wanted a fast computer. But after that stunning experience, I wanted both beautiful and fast computer. Other brand that came into my mind was Sony Vaio. Apple did that.</p><p>It took me a year to work and save in order to buy the MacBook I am currently using to type this post. It might be one of the best money I have spent in these years.</p><p>I don’t know about you. But I love how I don’t need to be bothered fixing registry. I love how I don’t need to install 3rd party plugin to get my works done. I love how I don’t need to install driver just to get the display works.</p><p>I don’t know if Apple is going to be like that forever. But I’m sure that as long Steve Jobs stay in the company, this love for their products would never change.</p><p>And while you are at it, why don’t you read this <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/63295/john-sculley-on-steve-jobs-the-full-interview-transcript/" title="John Sculley On Steve Jobs, The Full Interview Transcript | Cult of Mac">interview with the former Apple CEO</a>.</p><p>Of course, I will be very glad to talk to you on <a href="https://twitter.com/sayzlim" title="Sayz Lim (sayzlim) on Twitter">Twitter</a> if you are also an Apple fan.</p></article></section></main><aside class="sidebar"><div class="sticky-box"> <form class="form" action="https://app.convertkit.com/forms/2056450/subscriptions" method="post" data-sv-form="2056450" data-uid="c249fe0755" data-options="{&quot;settings&quot;:{&quot;after_subscribe&quot;:{&quot;action&quot;: &quot;redirect&quot;,&quot;redirect_url&quot;: &quot;https://sayzlim.net/welcome/&quot;}}}"> <label for="name">First Name</label> <input type="text" value="" name="fields[first_name]" placeholder="First Name" id="name" required> <label for="email">Email</label> <input type="email" value="" name="email_address" placeholder="Email Address" id="email" required> <button class="subscribe">Subscribe</button> </form><div class="sidebar-promo form"><p>Download CleanMyMac X, CleanShot X, and ClearVPN and other 30++ macOS applications for only $9.99/month.<br><a href="/is-setapp-worth-it/">Read More</a></p></div><div class="carbon-box"> <script async src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYIC2JI" id="_carbonads_js"></script></div></div></aside><footer class="footer"> &copy; 2010–2021 Sayz Lim | Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a></footer></div>
