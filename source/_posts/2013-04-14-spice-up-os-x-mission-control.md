<p>Modification is rarely recommended for new OS X users. You don’t want to spend your time struggling reverting system to default settings. However, with little personalization, you can dramatically change the way how your Mac looks, especially when it’s the workspace you use every day.</p>

<p>Mission Control with its linen background becomes boring if you’re used to all the linen in OS X. What if we can replace the background with other pattern that looks better than the overused linen? It turns out that there is an easy way to replace Mission Control’s background without risking your OS X default settings. The first thing you have to do is <a href="http://subtlepatterns.com">selecting some nice patterns</a>.</p>

<p>As soon as you’ve picked your favorite pattern<sup id="fnref:p47939324665-1"><a href="#fn:p47939324665-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, download <a href="http://www.moritzwette.com/liondesigner/">Lion Designer</a> made by <a href="http://www.moritzwette.com">Moritz Wette</a>.
