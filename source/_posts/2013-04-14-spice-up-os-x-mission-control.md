Modification is rarely recommended for new OS X users. You don’t want to spend time reverting system to default settings. However, with little personalization, you can dramatically change the way your Mac looks, especially when it’s the workspace you use every day.

Mission Control with its linen background becomes boring if you’re used to all the linen in OS X. What if we can replace the background with other pattern that looks better than the overused linen? It turns out that there is an easy way to replace Mission Control’s background without risking your OS X default settings. The first thing you have to do is [choose some nice patterns][0299-001].

As soon as you’ve picked your favorite pattern[^1], download [Lion Designer][0299-002] made by [Moritz Wette][0299-003]. This simple tool allows you to replace many low level OS X configurations[^2] while providing a safety button to revert back to default settings.

Lion Designer will automatically relaunch the Dock whenever you make changes. After applying the new pattern, you should be able to spot the difference. Hence, enjoy your new Mission Control.
