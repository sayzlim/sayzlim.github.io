> [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTM1NjQ5ODQ5 "Dropbox") is the easiest way to store, sync, and, share files online.

I think not many people know Dropbox. Dropbox is a multi-tools which can be used in many ways. It has a simple concept for syncing and sharing files online.

Few days ago, I encountered a small problem using Dropbox. The usual contextual link when I right-click the folder disappeared. It doesn’t bother since I don’t share my files to others. But problem is problem, if there is something wrong with my laptop, then I’ll solve it.

For you who use Dropbox on Mac and encountered the similar problem, here is the solution.

- Go to System Preferences-&gt;Keyboard-&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts
- From the list on the left, choose &#8220;Services&#8221;
- Make sure the &#8220;Folder Actions Setup…&#8221; is checked, if it is not. Check it.

Once you enable the Folder Actions Setup, I am sure that you can right-click your Dropbox folder to have their contextual link appear.
