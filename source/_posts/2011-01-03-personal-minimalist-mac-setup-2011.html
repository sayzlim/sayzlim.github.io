<p>Embracing minimalism is the path to stay focused. Embedding minimalism approach in the gadget you use is often misunderstood with removing everything to a plain white paper. <a href="http://www.sayzlim.net/post/1506476982/">Know your needs</a> is the first step have a minimalist setup. This post reflect my implementation of minimalist approach for my Mac setup this year.</p>

<p>I have made several change for the system preferences. Some of them to disable the services I never use.</p>

<p>The first thing I change is the Appearance color and highlight color to Graphite. And I change all the number of recent items to &#8220;None&#8221;. The Desktop and Screen Saver remain the same, except that I disable the Translucent menu bar.</p>

<p>The dock position is now on the left bottom side. I used to have them at the bottom, but now I have them pinned on the left side. You can also have this effect by typing the line below into terminal:</p>

<p><strong>defaults write com.apple.dock pinning -string end</strong></p>

<p>To gain more screen space, I set the Dock to automatically hide itself. While the Dock is a nice indicator for the running applications, I don&#8217;t see the need to have them on screen all the time. I also disable the opening applications animation.</p>

<p>Expose and Spaces is the most amazing feature in OS X. I enabled them the first year of using Mac. After a while, I realize that I don&#8217;t need it very much. The only setting I have them enabled are the Active Screen Corners where All Windows for the upper left and Desktop for the upper right.</p>

<p>As for Language and Text, I remove all the language except English. I never enable the input menu in menu bar and only enable the language I always use. There is only English in input sources. I will have Chinese as one of my input sources one day. Yes, I will.</p>

<p>Snow Leopard has some new configuration in security panel. I set my Mac require password to login after 1 hour and disable automatic login for security issue. Of course, I let the Firewall turned on. The other setting are left unticked. Untick &#8220;Use secure virtual memory&#8221; if you&#8217;re sure you won&#8217;t get hacked because it gives a little performance boost. Only do it when you know what you are doing.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t use Spotlight anymore since I have Alfred. So I disable all the setting in Spotlight. There is always a <a href="http://www.sayzlim.net/alfred-app-vs-spotlight/">reason</a> for me to give up certain feature.</p>

<p>CDs and DVDs? Ignore. Please remove it for the next Mac generation Mr. Steve Jobs.</p>

<p>No MobileMe. I delete all the list on Network except the AirPort because I rarely bring my MacBook out. And I don&#8217;t use cable when I go out anyway. Bluetooth is disabled since I don&#8217;t use it. Of course, I turn off all the service at Sharing.</p>

<p>Since I know what I&#8217;m doing. There is no need to create a separate administrator account. There is only one account which is mine. Having the guest account disabled ensures that nobody can access your Mac. Have only essential apps included in the &#8220;Login items&#8221;. Remove all the services you don&#8217;t use everytime you turn on your Mac.</p>

<p>To sum up this post, remove and disable unnecessary.</p>
