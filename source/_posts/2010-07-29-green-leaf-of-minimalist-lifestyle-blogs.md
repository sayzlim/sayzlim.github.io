## Less Than Three

I used to read many blogs. As the result, I felt overwhelmed by those information. So I decided to strap down the blogs I read from 10 to 3. And the result is refreshing. I can concentrate better and understand the purpose of each posted articles.

## Subscribe by Email

It is better to subscribe by email.

Subscribing via RSS is not recommended if you’re not a tech savvy. You might have problem starting up or you will mess up your configuration without your acknowledge. It is not a big deal, but why create problem for yourself?

The best thing to subscribe by email is you will be notified faster and you are likely to read the article. The choice is yours.
