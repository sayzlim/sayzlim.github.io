They finally replaced the old icon with the brand new one which is designed by Anna from [icons8](http://icons8.com/ "Free download of 1600+ icons in Windows 8 and iOS 7 style — Icons8"). Although the previous icon is lacking to be proudly displayed on your Dock, the functionally of ImageOptim can’t be disregarded.

I use ImageOptim all the time to optimize the images published on this blog. You can easily reduce the JPG up to 45% with it. ImageOptim is not just useful, but, with the brand new icon, it’s becoming more beautiful.
