Internet Explorer 6 is a nightmare for web developers and designers. Internet Explorer itself is not the best browser for web savvy user. It’s slow, bloated with useless features, and has a unfriendly UI — if not horrid.

Every old time web user know that IE 6 doesn’t support multiple tabs. You have to open new window for each link you click and eventually creating clutter on your desktop. You can’t possibly having 20 tabs opened at the same time during the IE 6 days - even with powerful desktop during that time.

The UI is filled with useless toolbars. It took up a large amount of your desktop screen. You had hard time figuring how to configure it properly. Not until you discover a better browser.

Despite the flaws above, I have learned precious lessons from using IE 6. It taught me how to use resources wisely, overcoming the flaws, and focus.

## Resources

Every computer comes with a limited number of memory and RAM. In another word, your computer is limited by the ability to process and retain running apps under optimal speed.

If you don’t pay attention to these used resources, you are likely to experience slow performance caused by it. Some people will say &#8220;Hey, this computer is damn slow&#8221; without realizing the fact that they don’t make use of the resources efficiently. So you get a faster computer with larger resources and eventually end up saying &#8220;This computer is still too slow!&#8221;. Reason - inefficient use of resources.

## Overcoming Flaws

Things that exist are not perfect. Apps are not perfect. There is this one particular app that works well, but not perfect. I have used some apps before and complained the lack of certain features that actually exist in the preferences. All I need is a little effort to pay attention to the preferences.

Maybe you need to take some time to study it. You can’t always rely on developers documentation because some apps are not well documented. You have to be proactive and discover apps value by yourself.

## Focus

One of the habits I try to implement is the use of only one tab in browser. I try to keep the usage of tabs as low as I can in order to save resources and stay focus on the task on hand.

Let me tell you, it doesn’t work well. We always need temporary memory to remind us where we are. Tabs can remind how far you have gotten.

Multiple tabs opened means distraction, but not always. If you open new tab for the sake of venturing deeper the information of existing tab, you can call that as form of focus. However, if you have multiple unrelated tabs opened. They’re definitely the proof of distraction.

Computing is not all about computer. It requires the human ability to bring the best out of it. Upgrading hardwares and softwares are not enough, you need to upgrade your ability. The ability to use them efficiently.
