title: 6 Basic Alfred App Extensions
tags:

The release of Alfred 0.9.9 has added a feature for users with experience in Apple Script, Shell Script, and Automator to extend Alfred capability beyond what it can do. If you’ve made a switch from Spotlight to Alfred, I hope this list adds another reason for you to get Power Pack upgrade. Even without Power Pack, you should also try Alfred.[^1]

- **[Connection Speed](http://blog.b42.eu/?p=44 "Connection Speed Alfred")** measures your connection speed and displays the result with Growl.[^2] It has helped me save many steps required in speed test site to get the same result.

- **[Flush DNS](http://cl.ly/8Gfg "Flush DNS Alfred")** flushes DNS.

- **[Memory Purge](http://s3.sayzlim.net/f/alfred-memory-purge.zip "Memory Purge Alfred")** can save you from countless reboot by claiming back unused and inactive memory on your Mac. I made this extension by using the shell script I learned from [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/) 2 years ago.

- **[Rebuild Open With…](http://s3.sayzlim.net/f/alfred-rebuild-open-with.zip "Rebuild Open With…")** is an extension that can solve your problem with Open With… item lists. Some apps still exist in the Open With… item lists even after uninstallation. This extension rebuild the item association list with all existing apps.

- **[Toogle Desktop](http://s3.sayzlim.net/f/alfred-toggle-desktop.zip "Toggle Desktop Alfred")**. I’m not the first one to come up with this extension. However, this is the first extension I built with code reference from [Don Southard](http://www.twitter.com/binaryghost).

- **[Toggle System Files](http://www.dirtdon.com/?p=886)** lets you show and hide system files that are usually hidden.
