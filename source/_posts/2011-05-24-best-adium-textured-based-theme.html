<p>Adium has always been my favorite IM client because of its support to many IM services and the ability to customize theme. I&#8217;ve shared <a href="http://sayzlim.net/post/731096029/">my personalized theme</a> using modifications crafted by several authors at DeviantArt and it remains one of the popular posts in this blog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been browsing for Adium theme recently and discover some beautiful themes. This is one of the best textured based Adium theme I&#8217;ve seen so far. In this post, I&#8217;m going to share all the mods I&#8217;ve applied for this theme.</p>

<h3>Birdie Dock Icon</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve never seen any Adium dock icon that is beautiful while still maintaining the original Adium mascot. <a href="http://arrioch.deviantart.com/art/Birdies-153678215">Birdie</a> is the dock icon crafted by <a href="http://arrioch.deviantart.com/">arrioch</a> featuring a cute little green bird. The reason why I love this icon is the cute animation and how it resembles the Adium original dock icon. That is also the reason why I don&#8217;t like the idea of using iChat icon as the replacement for Adium icon.<sup id="fnref:p5805473417-1"><a href="#fn:p5805473417-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h3>iDium Contact List Style</h3>

<p>This is where I contradict with my previous statement. There are many contact list styles for Adium. But I find that the most suitable theme for this whole package of modification goes to iDium contact list style. Originally made by <a href="http://dribbble.com/pritthish">Pritthish</a> and now maintained by <a href="http://macthemes.net/forum/profile.php?id=13331">gnome</a>, they try to bring iChat user interface to Adium.</p>

<p>You can achieve the iChat UI by <a href="http://macthemes.net/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=677432#p677432">downloading iDium Beta mod</a>. But in this case, we&#8217;re not going to use all the mod provided, instead we&#8217;ll only use the contact list style, and the plugin that modifies the input message style.</p>

<h3>Taz Message Style</h3>

<p>One of the best textured based message style. Also crafted by Pritthish, <a href="http://pritthish.deviantart.com/art/Taz-206139153">Taz</a> uses the color combination found in Twitterrific with many details refined. Enable the header by navigate to <strong>Preferences: Messages: Show header</strong>. There is only one word to describe Taz, beautiful.</p>

<h3>Toolbar Icon Update</h3>

<p><img src="http://images.sayzlim.net/2011/05/adium_toolbar.jpg" alt="Adium Toolbar Update"/></p>

<p>It&#8217;s not part of the mod, but if you find the existing Adium toolbar icons outdated and wish to replace with something new and shiny. Consider the mod made by <a href="http://bogo-d.deviantart.com/">Bogdan</a> which is much much better than the existing one. I especially like the <strong>Appearance</strong> icon included inside the package. <a href="http://bogo-d.deviantart.com/art/Adium-Toolbar-Update-v1-3-161226504">Download the mod</a> if you&#8217;re interested.</p>

<h3>Download This Theme</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve included all the links to all the mods I&#8217;ve used in this customization in each paragraph. If you prefer an easier way to customize theme without having to visit each site separately, I&#8217;ve included a package that contains all the files required to change your Adium theme, except the toolbar icons.</p>
