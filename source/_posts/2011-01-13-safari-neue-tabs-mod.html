<p>Stumbled <a href="http://www.koshic.com/?p=1098">Safari Tabs Collection</a> by Koshic<sup id="fnref:p2716943734-1"><a href="#fn:p2716943734-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> few days ago. The mod is impressive. It makes Safari tabs a lot more cleaner. Well, a picture tells a thousand words.</p>

<p>I take a particular like to the Safari Neue Tab. The UI design gives out an entirely different experience if you&#8217;re new to it. But once you get a hang of it, it looks superb.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The mod doesn’t work in the latest Safari. But you can give it a try, the author might update it to ensure the compability with the latest Safari.</p>

<p>Visit <a href="http://www.koshic.com">Koshic&#8217;s site</a> and take a look at his impressive works. It is made in HTML 5, so Safari 5 might have a slow problem to render it. <a href="#fnref:p2716943734-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
