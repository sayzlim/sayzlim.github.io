Stumbled Safari Tabs Collection by Koshic[^1] few days ago. The mod is impressive. It makes Safari tabs a lot more cleaner. Well, a picture tells a thousand words.

I take a particular like to the Safari Neue Tab. The UI design gives out an entirely different experience if you’re new to it. But once you get a hang of it, it looks superb.

> **Update 2013-10-12**: The mod doesn’t work in the latest Safari. But you can give it a try, the author might update it to ensure the compability with the latest Safari. The site is no longer available. But you still can download the mod from the link above.

[^1]: Visit Koshic’s site and take a look at his impressive works. It is made in HTML 5, so Safari 5 might have a slow problem to render it.
