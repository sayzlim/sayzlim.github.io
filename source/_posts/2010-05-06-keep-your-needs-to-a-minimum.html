<p>The modern American economy is built on the false premise that people need to buy new goods and services all the time. Again, I call bullshit.</p>

<p>People need fresh air, healthy food, clean water, exercise, creative stimulation, companionship, self-esteem and a safe place to sleep.</p>

<p>All of these things are simple to obtain. Most of them are free.</p>

<p>For fresh air, go outside. For exercise, take a walk. For creative stimulation, go somewhere new. For companionship, make a friend. For self esteem, turn off your TV, breathe deep and open your spirit to the basic goodness of the world.</p>
