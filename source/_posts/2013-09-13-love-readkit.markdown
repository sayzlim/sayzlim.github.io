Let’s admit it.
ReadKit is not the best RSS Reader out there.
We have Reeder, and many more apps that can do the same stuffs.
So why use ReadKit?
Are we left with little choices?

I don’t recommend an app unless I’ve grown accustomed to it.
There is this kind of familiarity when you’ve used an application every day.
What does it do? What can it do? I didn’t realize it can do such a thing.
Every day I’m surprised by the little thing an app can deliver.
Just like when I started to use OS X in my first year.
Many things to learn and discover.
Today I’m still doing the same. Endless knowledges to be learned.

A little details about my current setup.
I’m using Feedbin[^1] to sync all my feeds.
On Mac, definitely, I’m using ReadKit.
On iPad mini, I use Mr. Readers which does its job extremely well.
Shawn and others are recommending Feed Wrangler.
Their main reason is to create a smart stream to monitor news.
I prefer to take control of what I read.
I don’t subscribe to news blog.
I pick blogs I read.
That’s why I choose Feedbin.
It’s a feed services where you can tag your feeds.
That’s it.
No hassles.
Just your subscriptions and tags.

ReadKit.
It started as an application to sync your unread items in Pocket, Instapaper, and Readibility.
I bought it during its first releases and eventually it manages to replace Reeder as my main application to read feeds on Mac.
Design wise. It resembles Reeder in many areas.

I like to keep the area of discussion focused on the reading experience.
After all, feeds is about reading.
I won’t go further how smarts Feedbin or ReadKit helping you follow tons of news.
ReadKit keeps your feeds organized.
The reason is the Smart Folders.

Smart Folders is basically a [folder with set of rules](!g "nested rules site:sayzlim.net").
You use to live updating feeds that contain your criteria.
How can you make use of it well?

The first smart folder you can create is Unread folder.
It stores all the feeds you haven’t read in one folder.
You can all it all items, but I prefer to name it Unread.
I also add a rules to exclude feeds from sites with high volumes of updates.
You can easily do this by adding this rule below.

You’re basically telling smart folder to exclude feeds from a folder.
I regularly keep track of all the latest bookmarked sites on Pinboard. I don’t care how much new items are bookmarked, but I don’t want them to litter my main unread items. By excluding them, I can gain the clear view of how many unread items are left, how many updates available.

I also prefer to keep the unread badged and unread counts beside folder turned off.
Trying to finish of all the unread items is not an achievement I’m proud of.
I like to read the articles slowly and note down everything I find useful.
If you’re regular RSS users. Don’t let the thought of mark as unread a daily goal.
Your main purpose is to read.

Another smart folder I keep is Past Week. It lists all the items I’ve saved in Instapaper and Pocket in the past week[^2].
I’m never bothered to archive or mark an item as read in Instapaper nor Pocket.
If it’s read, the they’re read.
An extra step to mark item as read is trivial.
We can live without it.
Sometimes a designer simply need to ask if user can live without that button.

Although it’s not as smart as the Feed Wrangler.
You can still make use of smart folder to filter post with your chosen keywords.
Let’s say iOS 7 is the talk of the town.
In order for you to see post talking about it, you can create a smart folder with the selected keywords.
It’s a good way to filter out what you want to read.

### Performance Wise
There are a couple of tricks to make sure ReadKit doesn’t go wild.
The first I think I recommend it to keep read items for only one day.
The second it to only sync it once a day; you don’t need to refresh hour from hour. Check your feeds about once a day, preferable after you’ve done your main tasks of the day. Also enable caches images locally to speed up everything.

### Design Wise
As I’ve mentioned, it‘s better to turn off icon badge and items count.
Set the list height to minimum so you can only see the titles of feeds. It’ll show more items in the list.
Theme is subjective, but I prefer Light theme. Dark on white always work better for readibility.
Align text to left.
Optima Regular 18 as font choice.
Set line height and width as shown below.

ReadKit might not be the best app out there. But the options and the number of services it supports has manage to bring it to the top with all the efforts put by developers this past few months. I can feel that they‘re trying their best to cater all the needs of RSS users.

I have expecation of what an app and services can do. Most of times, they take time. Instead of complaining, I find the workaround to bring the best out of an app so I can find joy while using it. So, did I manage to persuade you to buy ReadKit, and better yet, love it?


[^1]: I still recommend Feedly if you prefer a free RSS sync services. ReadKit also supports Feedly, or you can [use Fluid](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/07/01/create-your-own-feedly-mac-app/) if you need a desktop app.
[^2]: I [use both Instapaper and Pocket](!g "instapaper pocket site:sayzlim.net").
