Not everyone likes ReadKit. Not everyone loves Tweetbot. That’s one thing I feel grateful. Imagine the world where everyone share the same taste. That would be boring. The differences in design and engineering style have created numerous of apps for us to use.

But why ReadKit among all the available RSS reader for Mac?

It all comes down to the kind of RSS reader I need. A RSS reader that can help me to follow high volume feeds while providing an easy way to filter them out. At the same time, I also don’t want to feel obligated to follow all the latest updates.

ReadKit is the only Mac app that provides this level of customization.

With the death of Google Reader, you might be wondering which RSS services you should use. It comes down to preferences. Most of the bloggers I follow recommend Feed Wrangler. Their main reason to use Feed Wrangler is the smart streams feature it offers. Smart streams is basically a [folder with a set of rules](!g "nested rules site:sayzlim.net") for your feeds. Only feeds that fulfill the criteria will show up in your created stream.

I personally use Feedbin. It all comes down to this. If you want folder to organize your feeds, then Feedbin is the best choice available. It doesn’t use the term as folder. It uses tags. There is no folders, just tags and your subcriptions. That‘s all. No smart streams, no filter. Just a plain old RSS services.

Perhaps you’re just a casual user who doesn’t need all those paid options. An alternative would be using Feedly. Remember the useful smart streams I mentioned earlier? You can actually get it in ReadKit. It‘s called smart folders.

Smart folder is the same as Feed Wrangler’s smart stream. The only difference is smart folder is only available locally, not synced for all your devices.

I’m going to show how you can configure ReadKit so you can follow all the news without feeling overwhelmed. In fact, you’ll find the joy of staying updated once again thanks to ReadKit.

### Smart Folders Setup
There are several core folders you need to create first to kick start your experience.

**Unread Folder**: This folder contains all the feeds you haven’t read in one place. It’s a quick way to see how many updates from your subcribed blogs. I also add a rules to exclude feeds from the sites with frequent daily updates such as news site. I do this by excluding folder name, although you may exclude by feed names.

**Starred Folder:** If you frequently favorite articles, then this folder is a must have so you can view all your favorited bookmarks easily.

**Past Week:** This is a smart folder to show all the permanent  unread items in Instapaper and Pocket I’ve saved in the past week.[^2] There is no need to mark them as read items. If it’s read, it’s read. Why create additonal step that doesn’t add value into your reading experience?

Feed Wrangler’s smart stream allows you to filter posts by keywowrds and feeds. It means you can create a folder containing “iOS 7” from the feeds you choose or exclude. In fact, this type of filtering is more powerful than the one provided in Feed Wrangler which limited to including, without option to exclude feeds.

The only drawback with this setup is you can’t bring your smart folders to other devices. But I spend most of time skimming articles on Mac. It won’t be a problem for me.

### Keeping It Lean and Clean
Since ReadKit is not optimized for one service only, you might want to make sure it runs as fast as possible. I usually keep the read items stored for only one day as references while working on the article, or simply want to check out what I’ve read recently. Another thing you can do is to sync manually so it ReadKit only works when you need it.

To complete this setup, you might want to caches the image locally to speed up everything.

Reading should be a enjoyful activity. If you feel rushed to mark all items as read, then something is definitely wrong. The rule to enjoyful reading is **not knowing how much unread items left**. That’s it. Turn off your unread item badge count in Dock icon, turn off all the unread items count beside feeds and folders. See? You simply read when open ReadKit. Take a deep breath because you’ve just lifted the heaviest boulder by staying subscribed.

The finishing touch is to improve the typography of the interface. I prefer to keep the list height minimum so only post titles can be seen. It also allows more items displayed for user with small screen. Always align the text to left. I use Optima Regular 18 as my font choice. As for the line height and width follow the preferences below:

ReadKit might not be the best RSS reader out there. But judging from the number of services they’ve added and improvements they’ve made this past few months make me realize that they do care for their users.

We always have expectation of what an app and services can do, but we must also understand that implementing features requires time and decision. Try to find a way to make your exisitng app works and find the joy of learning to use it.

Did I manage to persuade you to buy ReadKit?


[^1]: I still recommend Feedly if you prefer a free RSS sync services. ReadKit also supports Feedly, or you can [use Fluid](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/07/01/create-your-own-feedly-mac-app/) if you need a desktop app.
[^2]: I [use both Instapaper and Pocket](!g "instapaper pocket site:sayzlim.net").
