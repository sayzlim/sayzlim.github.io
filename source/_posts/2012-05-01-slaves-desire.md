One doesn’t merely allow desire to take control of himself. Becoming aware of self, acknowledging the existence of ego, and continuously look into the origin of desire can allow one to see the impermanence and unsteadiness of desire.

Yet the desire, despite how fragile and unsteady, continuosly to occupy one ability to think. The thought of fulfilling desire will attempt to seek — or even make up — reasons, turning one into slave, and eventually surrendering himself to endless craving.

If only one acknowledges the existence of desire, its impermanence and unsteadiness, then he might be able to escape the destiny of slave and obtain what slave doesn’t have.

It’s freedom.
