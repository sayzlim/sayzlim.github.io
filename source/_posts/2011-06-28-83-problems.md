> “Everybody’s got problems.” said the Buddha. “In fact, we’ve all got 83 problems. Each one of us. Eightythree problems and there’s nothing you can do about it. If you work really hard on one of them, maybe you can fix it— but if you do, another one will pop right into it’s place. For example, you’re going to lose your loved ones eventually. And you’re going to die someday. Now there’s a problem, and there’s nothing you or I, or anyone else, can do about it.”

It doesn’t mean you stop taking care of your health. It doesn’t mean you stop teaching your children how to behave. It doesn’t mean you stop working hard in your life. Just because you’ll die one day, it doesn’t mean you need to stop trying.

What you need is to stop creating problems and the problems shall cease.
