<p>I’m not a photographer. I don’t take photos daily; not even with my iPhone. I believe photography is one of the activity that can develop one sense of beauty. The art of composition in expressing the moment from a single image is brilliant. It’s a craft which requires thousand hours of practice to be good.</p>

<p>One of the iPhone application I’ve discovered recently is designed for photographers.  It’s called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/reduce/id580474806?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Reduce</a>. It’s designed and built by <a href="https://twitter.com/thyraz">Tobias Wiedenmann</a>, an independent designer and developer from German, who also creates <a href="http://tobiaswiedenmann.com/taskeater/">Taskpaper</a>. The interface is beautiful. His <a href="http://dribbble.com/Thyraz">cartoonish detailed design</a> can be seen throughout this application which define the overall aesthetic beauty. Every features are aimed to provide simple and fast image processing on trip.</p>

<p>There are several basic features I think you’ll need as a photographer. You’ll need a simple method to resize, cleaning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format">Exif data</a>, and adding watermark if you regularly upload your photos to services such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" title="Welcome to Flickr - Photo Sharing">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>When you first open the application, you’ll realize that everything I’ve mentioned are presented in one screen. All the folders inside Photos application will be shown in a photo stack manner. Tapping the folder expands all photos within folder. Below you can find the option to toggle Exif data, image resize &amp; sharpening method, including Jpeg quality adjustment.</p>

<p>Each feature is self-explanatory. You can adjust the width by using the slider for pixel size which comes in pre-determined value. It’s a good thing that you can choose image width without  worrying the value might go past 1 or 2 pixels.</p>

<p>The setting button allows you to add a simple watermark. By simple, it means your watermark is only a text embedded into your post-processed images. Albeit simple, you can still configure how it is displayed. You can adjust the opacity and position the watermark. You can apply border for the images. You can determine the color of your text. You can pick the typeface out of 15 choices.<sup id="fnref:p38791130898-1"><a href="#fn:p38791130898-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Once you’re done with the configuration, you can preview the image first. The preview doesn’t fit to screen; so aside from taking a good look at how your watermark will look like, it doesn’t provide much help. Batch processing images can be done by select multiple photos at once before tapping «Start» button. Selected images are indicated by the magnifiying glass used for preview.  Processed images are saved inside the Reduce Export folder. If you’re satisfied with the result, you can also save it as preset for future use.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Reduce is a nifty and beautiful application to process photos taken with your iPhone. Although I use the iPad version in this review, I believe Reduce for iPhone is a perfect companion for your daily on the road photography. It’s designed with ease of use in mind. Give it a try and I think you’ll like it.</p>
