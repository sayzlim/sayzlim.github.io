> We are in such a hurry to grow up, and then we long for our lost childhood. We make ourselves ill earning money, and then spend all our money on getting well again. We think so much about the future that we neglect the present, and thus experience neither the present nor the future. We live as if we were never going to die, and die as if we had never lived. —  Paulo Coelho

Read again the quote above.

Done? Great, this is the question. Are you enjoying your life?

<!--more-->

"No, I’m not". That’s my answer, we always live in an irregular condition. Sometimes we feel happy, sometimes we feel down. And that’s normal for regular people like us.

We are worrying future so much that we never experience what is happening in present. Look at yourself, you are always chasing the goal beyond your reach and neglect it once your reach it. As the result, you never enjoy your achievement.

Life is not a race, it is a journey. It doesn’t matter how fast you reach your goal. It is about how you spend your journey, with whom do you spend your journey and how content you feel about your journey.

So once for a while, put aside everything and experience present. Don’t think for tomorrow, but feel the present. Spend your time with you family and friends. Enjoy the nature. Take a good nap. Wander around the street. Because you live in present.
