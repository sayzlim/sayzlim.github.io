<p>What to write? And for who do I write?</p>

<p>I rarely write about myself. I don&#8217;t think the visitors of this site would like find out more about me. If I analyze the keyword and the top content of my site, I&#8217;m sure that my visitors don&#8217;t care about personal post. Yeah, I said so because I myself don&#8217;t care who is the writer behind a blog if I visit it from searching Google. It&#8217;s one of the habit unless you know me personally in real life.</p>

<p>If you are one of this site readers. Thanks, it&#8217;s my honor. And I&#8217;d like to get know my reader more.</p>

<p>More or less, some of you might be a fans of certain blog. When I was learning how to design, my feed would be full of design blog. And it was huge scale of list post everyday published.</p>

<p>It was tiring.</p>

<p>So if you are in that state, be it design blog or lifestyle blog. If you can&#8217;t cope up with them. Limit yourself to 3-4 blogs.</p>

<p>And once more, don&#8217;t just follow what the blogger writes. You know better about what your needs and lifestyle. If you think what you are doing now works well. Don&#8217;t change. It&#8217;s your life and you decide how to live it.</p>

<p>Choose wisely what to read and what to follow. No one know better about you, and it&#8217;s about you and people around you. Being a follower of some blogs or guide is to discover more options in life. And the choice is yours.</p>

<p>If you have question or want to know a certain topics, let me know. I will try to discover it and share with you what I find.</p>
