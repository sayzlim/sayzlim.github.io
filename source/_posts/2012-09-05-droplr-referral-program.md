> For every new person you invite to use Droplr, once they’ve registered a free account, we’ll reward both of you with an extra 200mb in storage. We currently let you invite up to 20 people, which means up to 4GB of extra space.

I’ve mentioned how much I [adored Droplr](http://sayzlim.net/making-choice-between-droplr-and-cloudapp/) as my chosen link shortener and file sharing service. I’ll be glad to have another  4 GB in additional of current 10 GB storage size. If you haven’t tried it, you can use my [referral link](https://droplr.com/join/mm888zT9) to gain extra 200 MB.
