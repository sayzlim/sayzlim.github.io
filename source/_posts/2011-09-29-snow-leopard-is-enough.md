title: Snow Leopard Is Enough

Mac OS X has entered another major change. The first major change happened few years ago when Steve Jobs brought us Leopard  with a major UI change and over 300 new features.

I believe Lion is the second major overhaul of the user experience. Unlike Snow Leopard, Lion brings a new way to access and arrange your Mac. Instead of bringing you everything, Apple strives to show you the best way to use your Mac.

Despite many improvements Apple has made to Lion and what they believe would simplify their users. I haven’t upgraded my MacBook to Lion. The reason is fairly simple, current setup serves me very well.

Lion is built to be used with Multi-Touch Trackpad. The fullscreen — I prefer to call this focus mode — makes more sense if accessed using gesture instead of alt+tab, or Mission Control. You can’t maximize Lion potential as an OS if there is no Multi-Touch support in your machine.

I might have upgraded this MacBook to Lion if it has Multi-Touch support.

## Why I Choose Not to Upgrade

The main reason I use this MacBook is to help me creating. To let me share my thought by connecting word by word, to form sentence by sentence and turn them into an article.

Managing personal life has never been this easy with this MacBook. Integrating [Simplenote][8311-001] with [nvALT][8311-002] on this Mac to sync my notes across several machines. With a simple traditional Finder, I can easily organize my files into several categories. No fancy stuff, yet it works.

Now that I think about it carefully, I have everything I need with this MacBook. No frustration, it just works.

It’s not installed with the newest and latest technology. You can’t run graphic intensive games on this MacBook. It doesn’t have Multi-Touch support where you can utilize three finger-swipes to switch apps. It doesn’t have Lion installed.

But, it’s enough for me.
