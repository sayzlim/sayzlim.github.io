What makes you a Pro? If you’ve bought 1Password for Mac or 1Password for iOS Pro features, then you’re a Pro! I’d like to show you few more tips to bring the best out of 1Password Pro features — from organizing smart folders to securing your backup codes.

## Unleash the 1Password mini

1Password mini carries a lot of secret features. AgileBit has published a [comprehensive guide to unleash 1Password mini hidden ability](https://blog.agilebits.com/2014/10/27/1password-5-mac-mini-menubar-shortcuts/ "Agile Blog - 1Password for Mac Tips: meet 1Password mini and its ..."). Instead of repeating the same information, I’ll just share some my favorites.

I recommend everyone to [organize passwords under different vaults](http://sayzlim.net/organize-1password-vaults "Organize 1Password Accounts With Vaults - Sayz Lim"), but switching between vault is a nuisance if you have open 1Password as front application. Save yourself from that trouble by activating 1Password mini and press `Command-Number` for quick access to vaults.

Need to copy Twitter password into third-party application? Search for Twitter in 1Password mini, select it, and press `Command-Shift-C` to copy the password.

Signing up for a new login item means the website field is stored with `/signup` or `/register` at the end of URL. Edit these items with an inline window by pressing `Command-E`, and when you’re done, just press `Command-S` to save the change.

## Custom Field for Security Question

Security question is the weakest form of online protection. It’s easy to figure out your birthday. It’s easy to figure out where your father and mother met. Don’t even make me guess your pet’s name — these secret answers are available on Facebook.

How can you create a strong security questions? [Be random](http://sayzlim.net/digitalshelf/passwords "Manage Your Passwords Online - Sayz Lim"). You can generate password in 1Password as the answers, or you can just punch in random combination of words and save them under new custom field.[^1]

Trust me. They’ll never figure out that your mum’s name is *Shrek The Mighty Butterfly* or *Baymax The Belly Bell Nurse*.

## One Login Item for Multiple Sites

If you’re active on StackOverflow, you might want to combine the username and password under Stack Exchange. Instead of creating a separate login item for each website, you can enter the second website under the same login item.

Now, go ahead and put your Apple ID with iCloud ID together.

## Group Smart Folders Together

Here is a little trick you can use to organize any folders in your projects. Group similar folders together by prepending them with a unique symbol or emoji — such as ∞ for smart folders. You  can find these symbols under the menu item at `Edit… » Special Characters`.

## Attach Scanned Documents to 1Password

Your identities are secured in 1Password. Keep a scanned copy of these identities attached to each item.[^2] You don’t need a scanner to go paperless — I use [Scanbot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanbot-document-scanner-qr/id834854351?mt=8&uo=4&at=11ld6n&ct=scanbot+document+scanner+qr "Scanbot · Document Scanner & QR Reader") to scan everything and save them into Evernote. This is an important measure to take so you can have a digital copy as backup when you lose the original copy due to unfortunate events.

[^1]: Custom field is also a great feature to store your backup verification codes — such as the one you receive from Google and Dropbox. You can change the label type into password from the dropdown menu on the right side of label.
