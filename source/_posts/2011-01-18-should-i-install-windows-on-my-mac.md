No. There is no reason for me to install Window on my Mac. I can do all what Windows can [do with a Mac](http://sayzlim.net/minimal-living-with-macbook "Minimal Living with MacBook | Sayz Lim"). There are many applications that perform better than Windows applications.

However, it is not about me, it is about you.

### Should you install Windows on your Mac?

Yes, if you

- absolutely need to run some games that can only run on Windows.
- need to run Windows applications that can do what Mac canâ€™t do.
- work in the environment where Windows is demanded.
- love Internet Explorer.

### Windows Applications Alternative

Unless you need to do exactly one of the list above, there is no need to install Windows. Mac Developers craft beautiful applications. The only problem you are facing is probably the limited knowledge on existing Mac applications. You can ask for suggestion from Mac community because they know better what works well.
