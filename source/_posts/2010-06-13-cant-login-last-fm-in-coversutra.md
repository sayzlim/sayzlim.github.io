CoverSutra, a third party iTunes controller application, is a well designed application with its sharp icon on menu bar. It is one of the application which can&#8217;t be replaced by other application. Simple with minimal feature for playlist control.

However, even the best arts have flaw. There will be a case where you can&#8217;t login into your last.fm account with CoverSutra. If you keep trying to login despite the internet connection is working fine and the last.fm server is not down. Then you can fix it by set your date and time automatically at system preference.

First make sure the [last.fm server](http://status.last.fm/ "Last.fm Status") is not down.

If the server is not down, you can open the date and time setting and put a check on beside **Set date and time automatically**. Try to login again and it&#8217;ll solve your problem.
