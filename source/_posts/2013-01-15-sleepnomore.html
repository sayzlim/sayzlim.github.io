<blockquote>
  <p>Sleep No More is a tiny menu bar application, that allows you to prevent your Mac from sleeping for a specified amount of time. Enjoy modern animated interface with a rotary time-setting dial. Prevent computer sleep, display sleep or both of them simultaneously. Automatic launch at system login option is also available. Should we mention its completely free?!</p>
