  <p>For every new person you invite to use Droplr, once they’ve registered a free account, we’ll reward both of you with an extra 200mb in storage. We currently let you invite up to 20 people, which means up to 4GB of extra space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve mentioned how much I <a href="http://sayzlim.net/making-choice-between-droplr-and-cloudapp/">adored Droplr</a> as my chosen link shortener and file sharing service. I’ll be glad to have another  4&#160;GB in additional of current 10&#160;GB storage size. If you haven’t tried it, you can use my <a href="https://droplr.com/join/mm888zT9">referral link</a> to gain extra 200&#160;MB.</p>
