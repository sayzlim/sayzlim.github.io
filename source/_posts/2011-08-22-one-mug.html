<p>Washing dishes is one of my favorite activity. Although I like washing dishes, it doesn&#8217;t mean I love to see the pile of dishes especially cups and mugs.</p>

<p>I have this one simple rule for my family and me.<sup id="fnref:p9251646749-1"><a href="#fn:p9251646749-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Each of the family member only has their own mugs. If you want to use it, you have to wash it. If you don&#8217;t wash it, don&#8217;t drink.</p>

<p>Prepare a separate set of utensils for guests. Also prepare a set of utensils for family. This simple rule can help you remove unnecessary utensils and cut down the needs to wash dishes.</p>

<p>As for now, I&#8217;m the only one abiding this rule. <a href="#fnref:p9251646749-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
