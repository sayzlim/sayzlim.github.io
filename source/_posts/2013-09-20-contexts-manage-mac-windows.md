description: Contexts keep your cluttered application windows on Mac organized without sweat.
---

Working with many applications at once can create clutter when you have small screen. MacBook Air can only handle this much applications windows at once. Running Safari, Firefox, and Chrome to test the change made on the website. Writing down notes in nVALT and editing images in Pixelmator. I also need to keep the Terminal running if I want to commit some changes for the files I’m working on. There is no more spot left.

I discovered an app called Contexts recently. It’s another third party app to boost your productivity by providing an easy way to manage and search for your active windows.

I don’t want to install too much third party apps. I questioned how useful this app could be, lost in thought, and finally give it a test.

I’m trying to reduce the number of third party applications in this Mac. I must admit once in a while I’ll add an application into my toolbox. The prerequisites for them to be included is simple. They need to be useful.

If you’re like me, working with small screen, and sometimes need a few seconds to find the window you need from all the windows in Mission Control, then you’ll love Contexts. It’s not difficult to say this app is worthy to stay at the sidebar on your desktop, but the main point is it’s better than I thought.

### Comparison to Task Switcher
Contexts is different. It’s not the task switcher like we’re used to use with `Command + Tab`. It actually complements the task switcher, by being more than just task switcher. It switches application windows.

I’m using it along with built in Task Switcher. At first, I thought I could use to replace the task switcher entirely. But there is no way to replicate the functionality that the task switcher offers completely. While Contexts can be used to filter through the pile of active windows, Task Switcher at its best still the best for switching between windows without relying the shift key. Moreover, Task Switcher can be used to hide and quit apps.

Both of them should be used together to tame all your active applications and windows.

### Using Contexts
The way I use Contexts is more visual. I keep the sidebar visible at the bottom right so I can know how many windows are actually active. This is also a signal when I’m trying to get too much things done at once. If you open multiple Finder windows at once, Contexts will show them all as an individual icon in the sidebar. Hovering your mouse will show you the title of each window, making navigatin in Finder without tabs support easier.

Another problem that Contexts solve is to filter windows, especialy when you have more than 20 windows opened at once. By utilizing `Option+``, you can activate the search field to search for your windows. This is the most important feature which I like.

There is another shorcut to switch between windows — by using `Option+(Number)`.I don’t use this shorcut because it takes away main option to type symbols on Mac. Some of the keys are pretty common such as ™ and ∞. I hope there is a way to assign our own shortcuts, or at least modifiers to avoid keys conflict in the final release.

Undoubtfully, Contexts for Mac has become one of my tool to get things done on Mac. It’s unobstrusive and proves to be helpful when I want to know how many windows are active. It’s not a replacement for built in Application Switcher; [Witch](!g "witch for mac") is the one if that’s what you want.

You can get it for half price while it’s still in beta.
