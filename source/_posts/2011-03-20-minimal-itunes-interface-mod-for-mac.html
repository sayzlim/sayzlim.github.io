<p>There is one app with interface that I love to hate. The precious app that I run all the time to play music known as iTunes is the app with most modification in term of interface. The icon doesn&#8217;t match my taste and the user interface is too boring for daily use.</p>

<p>So I search for modification for the user interface and find this one particular sophisticated mod.</p>

<p>As you can see from the screenshots above, the icons are more simple without the border. It gives the embedded texture while keeping the interface clean from distraction.</p>

<p>Another important mod for this theme is the redesigned scrollbar for the list items. The scrollbar is similar to the scrollbar in iOS devices which feature a nice dark line.</p>

<p>While this theme is very well made, I can&#8217;t say it doesn&#8217;t come with bugs. If you turn on the iTunes sidebar, it actually use the default system scrollbar which doesn&#8217;t match well with the whole theme. However, it won&#8217;t be a problem if you don&#8217;t use the sidebar regularly like me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to post a step by step installation instruction here while keeping your iTunes safe from broken theme.</p>

<p>There are several things you need to keep in notes before proceeding to installation process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul><li>Make sure you have the latest iTunes or at least iTunes 10.2.1</li>
  <li>The theme might overlap with your other mod. So make sure you have the installation for other mod to ensure everything back to normal.</li>
  <li>Make sure the iTunes is not running.</li>
  </ul></blockquote>

<ol><li><p>Download the latest iTunes mnml by Joagil from his <a href="http://joaogil.deviantart.com/art/itunes-mnml-199347114">deviantart page</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.sayzlim.net/2011/03/itunes_show.jpg" alt="Show Package Contents"/></p></li>
<li><p>Follow the instruction on his page or simply follow mine. Find the iTunes app and right click the icon to show the package contents as shown in the screenshot.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate through to the folder called &#8220;Resources&#8221; and find a file called &#8220;iTunes.rsrc&#8221;.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.sayzlim.net/2011/03/itunes_content.jpg" alt="iTunes Package Contents"/></p></li>
<li><p>The &#8220;iTunes.rsrc&#8221; is the file that you&#8217;re going to replace later with your downloaded mod. Backup this file by copy it and paste to your defined location. To simplify, I usually backup the original file within the package by pasting it along with other folders inside contents like the screenshot.</p></li>
<li>Once you&#8217;re done with the backup, you can copy the mod &#8220;iTunes.rsrc&#8221; file you downloaded earlier from deviantart and overwrite the file inside the &#8220;Resources&#8221; folder.</li>
</ol><p>If you want to restore your iTunes interface to the original one, you can easily do it by replacing the &#8220;iTunes.rsrc&#8221; file with the backup you did earlier.</p>

<p>You can always ask me question if you encounter any problems using the contact form at the sidebar or simply say hi. I hope you enjoy this mod.</p>
