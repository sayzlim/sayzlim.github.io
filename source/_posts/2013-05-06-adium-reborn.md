I can’t wait to see the screenshot above becomes available. [Dawid Liberadzki][0911-001] and [Oskar Krawczyk][0911-002] have made a gorgeous Adium interface that matches the level of Adium’s engineering. The combination of matte background and subtle pattern turns Adium’s dullness into something more elegant.

Adium is one of the most worthy chatting application you can find for Mac. I’ve used it since I got my first Mac. It continues to stay in [my MacBook Air](http://sayzlim.net/new-macbook-air/) after adapting several themes: the [dark theme][0911-003] and the [textured based theme][0911-004]. I haven’t shared my latest one yet. Hopefully, I can simply use Adium Reborn as my main theme when it’s reborn.
