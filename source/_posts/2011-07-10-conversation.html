<p>When was the last time you really immerse yourself into a conversation? A conversation that is simply for fun. A conversation where you&#8217;re being yourself. A conversation where you use your mouth instead of fingers to express yourself.</p>

<p>A conversation is more than just typing a message and send it to your friends. It&#8217;s more than just BUZZing your friends. It&#8217;s more than just giving a phone call to your family. It&#8217;s more than just a simple LIKE button.</p>

<p>A conversation, I think, should incorporate expression, emotion, and interaction. It&#8217;s something expressive, just like writing, to convey your thought and opinion. The only difference is you&#8217;re given less time to think. You have to be spontaneous.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been having a lot of conversation with my family recently. We talked about why I haven&#8217;t found a job. I discussed with my sister-in-law about disciplining my niece. My sister and I would argue about her diet. I would complain the way my mum cook.</p>

<p>The conversations I mentioned are fun and exciting. I love how my sister sulks her face when I mention about her diet. I also enjoy the my mum&#8217;s laughter when she manages to tease me. I like the way my 2 years old nephew throwing tantrum when I don&#8217;t give him the food he wants.</p>

<p>So, when you hang out with your family or friends next time. Put down your gadget and have a conversation. This time, with your eyes on them, not on the non-living gadget.</p>
