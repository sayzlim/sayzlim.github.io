The sudden blackout cuts out the Internet connection and I’m left with this MacBook as my only source of light. Approximately, I have around 3 hours left to write.

Surrounded by a complete darkness and silence makes me realize what a noisy world we’ve been living all this time. Using this short moment, I think, can help to clear this mind from all the accumulated noises.

What I’m doing is pretty easy and simple. Find a comfort position. Listen to the silence. Don’t think about anything, just enjoy everything while I can.

Breathe. Pay attention to my breathe. Stay aware of each breathe.

It’s a very short moment. It’s only 20 minutes. But, this 20 minutes is what each of us need every day.
