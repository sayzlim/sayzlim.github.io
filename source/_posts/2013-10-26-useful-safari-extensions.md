Safari is one of the finest update we can receive in Mavericks. It’s [packaged with the WebKit2 engine][A31] that has been rewritten to handle multiple tabs better, similar to Google’s Chrome process-per-tab architecture. No longer we have to restart Safari when one of the tab crashes.

What makes Safari appealing is not the underlying technology; it’s the tight integration with OS X sporting consistent interface built on AppKit Framework.

With the release of Safari 5, developers can finally build extensions to make Safari better. Some of the them only [change the looks of the website][1], some of them [add functionality to Safari][2], and some of them [disable Flash on Safari][3].

Two years since my last post on Safari extensions; things have changed a lot. It’s difficult to find new Safari extensions  made these days. Although not as much like it used to, I still have many extensions installed. Here are the seven most useful extension that everyone will find useful.

## [Sessions](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8247646/sessions/index.html "Safari Extensions — Sessions by David Yoo")

Sometimes you need to work on a certain project or researching a certain topic that ends up with many open tabs. You can’t always finish the task in one session; you might wish to save all the open tabs together so it can be revisited later. Sessions lets you save them in single click. It also allows you to restore the previous browsing session on Safari launch. I’ve been using Sessions to save all the open tabs before Pinboard add **tabs feature**.

## [HoverZoom](http://sidetree.com/extensions.html "Side Tree Software - Safari 5 Extensions")
HoverZoom allows you to load the actual image size within web page. This extension is useful because you don’t need to open the image in new tab. Press **Shift** can make the image to fit inside browser. This is one of the most useful extension for you who browse photography sites.

## [WasteNoTime](http://www.bumblebeesystems.com/ "WasteNoTime")
Do you want to track and limit the time you spend on the websites you visit? You can have this feature built into Safari easily with WasteNoTime. By enabling this extension, you can decide how much time is allowed to spend on certain websites. You can also decide when the extensions are active — by adjusting allocated time effectively on weekdays and weekends.

## [Tab Options](http://canisbos.com/taboptions "Tab Options - Canisbos Safari Extensions")
By default, all new tabs will be created at the end of the tab bar. If you often use **Select Next Tab** and **Select Previous Tab**, having the new tab created right beside the active tab is preferable. With **Tab Options**, you can choose the the behavior how each new tab is handled. You can also put it in the beginning of tab bar, the left or the right of the active tab.

Shortcuts are available if you wish to control the tab positioning behavior. But I mainly use it to set the new tab to open in the right side of active tab.

## [Type-To-Navigate](http://dbergey.github.io/ "Safari Extensions by Daniel Bergey")
[Shortcat][5] for browsers. I use it to navigate within website. With Type-To-Navigate installed, I can visit the URL inside a webpage by typing. Install this and try to visit archive by simply typing “archive”, then press **return**.

## [LinkThing](http://canisbos.com/linkthing "LinkThing - Canisbos Safari Extensions")
If Tab Options controls how the new tab is created, LinkThing controls how the link within webpage are handled. This extension is great at dealing with websites that enforce link behavior onto user. Instead of letting them to decide how the links should be opened, we choose our own preferences.

My default preferences is to have all the offsite links[^1] opened in new tab and all the onsite links in current tab. You can also choose where the new tab should be created when a link is clicked — similar to Tab Options. If you dislike the complex URL made by Google, this extension can also rewrite them into direct URL.

## [URL Cleanser](https://github.com/akirk/url_cleanser "akirk/url_cleanser · GitHub")
No more manual removing the tracking URL from most of the websites. This extension will clean up all the tracking code inside a URL.

[^1]: Onsite links are the link pointing to the same domain, while offsite links are the links pointing to other domain.
