> Pierce had such a project: a little game called Connectrode, a Dr. Mario style puzzler he had created for his wife. He had made it before joining OMGPOP, and it hardly made any money, but Pierce had sentimental attachment to the game.

> When Pierce asked for an addendum to that contract, specifying that he be able to continue offering Connectrode on the iOS App Store, Zynga told him that he either had to sign the contract as it was written or walk.

If you got a dollar, buy [Connectrode](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/connectrode/id438450056?mt=8). As for Zynga, I dislike the way theyâ€™re doing business.
