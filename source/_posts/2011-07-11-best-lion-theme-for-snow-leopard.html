<p>With the Lion approaching in just a few days, it&#8217;s no wonder everyone will prepare their Snow Leopard for an upgrade. But, not in my case because I haven&#8217;t found any value in upgrading to Lion.</p>

<p>One of the reason is my MacBook doesn&#8217;t have multitouch support.  I&#8217;ve tried Lion GM on my friend&#8217;s MacBook Pro and conclude several things.</p>

<ul><li>My workflow doesn&#8217;t change even with gesture support.</li>
<li>I only use Expose, so Mission Control and Launchpad doesn&#8217;t increase my workflow.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t like sidebar icons and the overall feel of Lion.</li>
</ul><p>Basically, I feel that there are many things I won&#8217;t use later in Lion.</p>

<p>Of course, Lion is worth an upgrade, especially with the Mail 5 and many system enhancements. But, if there is one reason for me  upgrading to Lion is the GUI because I&#8217;ve never liked Aqua style.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;ve been searching and waiting patiently for someone to create a proper mod for Snow Leopard. A theme that fits perfectly with Snow Leopard and yet doesn&#8217;t overshadow default theme. Introducing&#8230;</p>

<h3>Snow Lion Theme</h3>

<p>If there is one thing I want to emphasize about using mod for your desktop is knowing who craft all these mods. <strong>Always telling them how you love the mod they made if you can</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Snow Lion</strong> is a theme crafted by <a href="http://lukeedee.deviantart.com/">lukeedee</a> to get similar button and progress bar in Lion. I can&#8217;t even believe that I&#8217;m on Snow Leopard after installing this theme. The button and progress bar alone add subtle difference to the whole OS.</p>

<h3>Thought</h3>

<p>While the theme is very well made, I can&#8217;t deny that it doesn&#8217;t entirely convince me to use every elements in the theme. There some elements that I want to replace with other mods.</p>

<p>First, the menubar background. I hate glossy effect on menubar, it puts too much attention on menubar, causing distraction when I&#8217;m working with my desktop.</p>

<p>Second, while the title bar controls are very well made, I&#8217;m used to a minimalist version of <a href="http://sayzlim.net/polished-traffic-lights-for-snow-leopard/">traffic lights</a>. And once again, it doesn&#8217;t distract me with those colorful buttons.</p>

<p>Last, since I&#8217;ve used a <a href="http://sayzlim.net/post/3965972245/">minimal mod</a> for my iTunes. I also hope the scrollbar is consistent across whole system.</p>

<h3>Combining All Elements</h3>

<p>I can&#8217;t install them one by one because it&#8217;ll overlap each time you install a new theme. So I combined them all under one theme.</p>

<p>I know some of you might want the similar theme of mine. But I won&#8217;t be able to share it to you right now because I need permission from each respective mod owner in order to combine them. Once I have their permission, I&#8217;ll post the download link here.</p>

<p>So here are the sneak preview of my combined theme.</p>
