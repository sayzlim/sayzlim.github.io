<ul><li><a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a> - the best multi-protocol instant messaging for Mac. There are times where I want to stop using it. However, most of my contacts use MSN as their instant messaging service. It become very nice once you know how to turn it into a beautiful application.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> - the replacement for Spotlight. It is fast, stable, simple, and not bloated with complicated feature. I understand the hesitant to switch from the lovely Spotlight to Alfred. There is always a reason for me to include it.</li>

<li><a href="http://metaquark.de/appfresh/">AppFresh</a> - this tools let me keep the applications up to date. There are alternative such as Bodega and MacUpdate. I prefer AppFresh because I can have the control over it to skip and exclude update.</li>

<li><a href="http://bowtieapp.com/">Bowtie</a> - one of the best iTunes controller I have used. Bowtie has one of the best control and Last.fm integration. Unlike CoverSutra, you can&#8217;t do quick search with it, but you can get a better experience by combining Bowtie with Alfred Powerpack.</li>
