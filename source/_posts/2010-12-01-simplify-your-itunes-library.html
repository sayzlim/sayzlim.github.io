  <p>You will learn some tips to organize your iTunes library and speed up your iTunes a little.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>1. Delete, Delete, Delete</h3>

<p>Delete all the albums you don&#8217;t listen for past a year. Delete all the albums that you don&#8217;t like. Delete all the albums that is not complete. Or you can move them to somewhere else. I never store music for more than 10&#160;GB.</p>

<h3>2. Fill The Missing Information</h3>

<p>Indexing the unorganized library is a huge task for iTunes. Start by filling the missing information of each album. The easiest way to locate information is not on Wikipedia. Instead, visiting the artist page can give a more correct information. If you&#8217;re stuck. Visit the <a href="http://musicbrainz.org">brain of music</a> for the largest music data collection.</p>

<h3>3. Genre and Composer is Secondary</h3>

<p>If you feel anxiety because the uncertain genre or composer. Stay calm. For genre, fill whatever you think is right. For composer, there is always an option to fill with &#8220;Unknown Composer&#8221;. You never browse music by composers anyway.</p>

<h3>4. Album Art, Google It</h3>

<p>The ideal image size for album cover is around 500px. If you don&#8217;t have options. Use the medium size.</p>

<h3>6. Simplify The View</h3>

<p>You don&#8217;t really need to know how many times you have listened a song. Neither do you need to know when was the last time you listened to it. Try to hide the information you don&#8217;t need. Type cmd + j can give you access to all available options. For your insight, the picture below shows you how I display my library.</p>

<h3>7. Keep It Organized</h3>

<p>Tell your iTunes to maintain your library. Copying the music to the iTunes folder location is always a nice choice. Afterward, you can delete the source files because your files has been saved into the iTunes folder.</p>
