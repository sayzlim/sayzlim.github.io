I used to use Simplenote as my main service to store my notes. Although I’ve replaced my workflow by using Dropbox as my main storage, due to tighter integration with OS X, Simplenote remains one of the service you can trust to store your precious notes.

Simplenote has completely redesigned their apps for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Their design is starkingly simple, showing Simplenote’s vision align with simplicity and clarity of iOS 7.
