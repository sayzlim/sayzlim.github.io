  <p>Three years ago when I bought the iMac, I dismissed the mini as too weak and actually looked at a Mac Pro. At one point, I thought about going to a “one Mac” solution and getting a 17” MacBook Pro, but the arrival of the iPad has made me totally reevaluate my computing needs and realize that — at least for me — a desktop powerful enough for my needs (which today’s Mac mini is) plus an iPad is a better trade off than a powerful portable computer.</p>
