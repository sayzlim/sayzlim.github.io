<p>The sudden blackout cuts out the internet connection and I&#8217;m left with this MacBook as my only source of light. Approximately, I have around 3 hours left to write.</p>

<p>Surrounded by a complete darkness and silence makes me realize what a noisy world we&#8217;ve been living all this time. Using this short moment, I think, can help to clear this mind from all the accumulated noises.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m doing is pretty easy and simple. Find a comfort position. Listen to the silence. Don&#8217;t think about anything, just enjoy everything while I can.</p>

<p>Breathe. Pay attention to my breathe. Stay aware of each breathe.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a very short moment. It&#8217;s only 20 minutes. But, this 20 minutes is what each of us need everyday.</p>
