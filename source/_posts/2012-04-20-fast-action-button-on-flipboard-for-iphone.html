<p>I’m a fan of sending article to my favorite Read Later application, Instapaper. Sending articles from Flipboard to Instapaper usually requires at least 2 steps.</p>

<p>Recently, I discovered a small neat built in Flipboard for iPhone feature that works very well. <strong>Fast Action Button</strong>, which can only be enabled for Twitter account, allows you execute quick action by skipping the share button. By default, it’s Favorite. However, you can also set it to Retweet or Read Later.</p>

<p>You can change the default behavior by going into Setting panel and choose Twitter to find Fast Action Button. It’s time saving and very useful.</p>
