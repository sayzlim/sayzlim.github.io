The little packages that fine tuning what Apple will not. If you don’t like the aqua scrollbar, consider the mod by [Max Rudberg](http://www.maxthemes.com/ "Max Rudberg - Visual &amp; User Interface Designer"). It is the form of beauty and simplicity.

There are 3 mods in there, I find that the second type is the best one since I don’t like the black menubar.
