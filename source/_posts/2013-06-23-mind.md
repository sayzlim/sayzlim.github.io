Don’t stop the mind. Don’t let the mind run wild. Don’t try to take over the mind. Watch over the mind.

Awareness is a popular word used by many teachers to help their students calming their minds. What do you gain under the constant pressure of family, society, and ultimately yourself? Nothing. Be alone for the next 15 minutes, turn off the light, listen to a song, and silently watch over the mind.

I know. It’s running wild. The mind is thinking.  A few seconds have passed. The mind is thinking how to watch over the mind. Perhaps it’ll start thinking about the food you’ve eaten this morning. Oh, I need to watch over the mind. If I’m watching the mind on purpose, am I still just a bystander?

It’s just a mind. Not yours. Not mine. Enjoy this 15 minutes.
