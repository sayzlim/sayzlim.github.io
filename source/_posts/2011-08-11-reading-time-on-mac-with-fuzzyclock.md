I love words. I love beautiful typography. FuzzyClock displays the time with words instead of numbers. With beautiful typeface, FuzzyClock looks elegant in menubar.

It doesn't have beautiful icon. So get a replacement for it. Install it, and you might fall in love with it.

And, if you use [Menubar icons v2](http://iandrew.deviantart.com/art/Menubar-icons-v2-Leopard-SL-120653580) by ~iAndrew, I have a few suggestions for you.

Download [CodeBold](http://fontfabric.com/code-free-font-3/) and  use the setting below.

If you plan to change the icon yourself, use official link. To use the modified one, use alternative link.
