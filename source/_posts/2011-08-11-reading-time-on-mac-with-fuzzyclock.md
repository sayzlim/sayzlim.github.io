I love words. I love beautiful typography. FuzzyClock displays the time with words instead of numbers. With beautiful typeface, FuzzyClock looks elegant in menu bar.

It doesn't have beautiful icon. So get a replacement for it. Install it, and you might fall in love with it.

And, if you use [Menubar icons v2][1] by ~iAndrew, I have a few suggestions for you.

Download [CodeBold][2] and  use the setting below.
