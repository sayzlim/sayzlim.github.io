<p>I think not many people know Dropbox. Dropbox is a multi-tools which can be used in many ways. It has a simple concept for syncing and sharing files online.</p>

<p>Few days ago, I encountered a small problem using Dropbox. The usual contextual link when I right-click the folder disappeared. It doesn&#8217;t bother since I don&#8217;t share my files to others. But problem is problem, if there is something wrong with my laptop, then I&#8217;ll solve it.</p>

<p>For you who use Dropbox on Mac and encountered the similar problem, here is the solution.</p>

<ul><li>Go to System Preferences-&gt;Keyboard-&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts</li>
<li>From the list on the left, choose &#8220;Services&#8221;</li>
<li>Make sure the &#8220;Folder Actions Setupâ€¦&#8221; is checked, if it is not. Check it.</li>
</ul><p><img src="http://images.sayzlim.net/2010/08/dropbox_actions.jpg" alt="Dropbox Folder Action Setup" title="Dropbox Folder Action Setup"/></p>

<p>Once you enable the Folder Actions Setup, I am sure that you can right-click your Dropbox folder to have their contextual link appear.</p>
