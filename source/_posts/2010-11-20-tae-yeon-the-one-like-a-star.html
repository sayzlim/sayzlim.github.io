<p>It must be a long time since the last post tagged with music. One of my favourite singer has released a single with her master.</p>

<p>You can listen to it by visiting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwk3t5I8lXg">this link</a>.</p>

<p>If you follow or visit this blog, I hope you understand that the topics of this blog is covered between the Apple, lifestyle and music I love. It will be nice to stay focused on the topic. But it won&#8217;t sound like me if I try to not be myself. I honestly believe that a writing should reflect oneself. And I am holding onto that belief.</p>
