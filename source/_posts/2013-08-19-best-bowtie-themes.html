<p>I’ve just cleaned all unused files from desktop. I turn on Rdio as one of the Bowlet<sup id="fnref:p58698770626-1"><a href="#fn:p58698770626-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> gradually appearing from the corner of the screen. It all thanks to Bowtie.</p>

<p><a href="http://bowtieapp.com/" title="Bowtie">Bowtie</a> is one of the most popular music controller you can find for OS X. It supports iTunes, Sonora, Spotify, and Rdio. It allows you assign shortcuts to control these music players from a single app. I’ve also shared some of <a href="http://sayzlim.net/post/2942690106" title="sayzlim.net: 3 Bowtie Themes to Beautify Your Desktop">my favorites Bowtie themes in 2011</a>.</p>

<p>More themes are designed for the past two years. I’ve been keeping my eyes on the new release of Bowtie themes and finally select these four themes as listed below.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.sayzlim.net/2013/08/bowtie_unnamed.jpg" alt=" [Unnamed Bowtie Theme by Cory][] " title="Unnamed Bowtie Theme by Cory"/></p>

<p><a href="http://beautifulblood.deviantart.com/art/Unnamed-255040591" title="Unnamed by =beautifulblood on deviantART">Unnamed</a> is the Bowtie theme I’ve been using for the past two years. It’s originally designed by <a href="http://th-guenther.deviantart.com/" title="th-guenther on deviantART">Thomas Günther</a>, and further developed by <a href="http://beautifulblood.deviantart.com/art/Unnamed-255040591" title="Unnamed by =beautifulblood on deviantART">Cory</a> who added right corner position support.</p>

<p>I like how Unnamed make use of small height to display song title and song artist. By positioning itself at the bottom of the screen, the theme will blend with the black edge on MacBook Air screen, as if it’s part of the design. Keeping the dock visible all the time helps you see the current playing track by just taking a glimpse.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.sayzlim.net/2013/08/bowtie_passed.jpg" alt=" [Passed by Ryan Christensen][] " title="Passed by Ryan Christensen"/></p>

<p><a href="http://rhyguy.deviantart.com/art/Passed-185291024" title="Passed by ~rhyguy on deviantART">Passed</a> is recommended if you prefer bolder and larger typefaces. The capitalized song title and song artist are perfect for larger screen. They also serve as a song indicator by filling up the transparency with solid white color. Best of all, you don’t need to find the matching wallpaper to see the beauty of this theme.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.sayzlim.net/2013/08/bowtie_embedded.jpg" alt=" [Embedded Bowtie by Ge Yinghui][] " title="Embedded Bowtie by Ryan Christensen"/></p>

<p><a href="http://ryange.deviantart.com/art/Embedded-Bowtie-152840982" title="Embedded Bowtie by ~RyanGe on deviantART">Embedded Bowtie</a> makes the cover looks embedded within wallpaper. The idea to combine album cover with the wallpaper is not new; you can find similar one in my previous roundups. However, Embedded is the only theme that can positioned almost everywhere on the screen without being obstrusive.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.sayzlim.net/2013/08/bowtie_neon.jpg" alt=" [Neon 2.0 Designed by Dmitriy Bourim][] " title="Neon 2.0 Designed by Dmitriy Bourim"/></p>

<p>Designed by <a href="http://zb3k.deviantart.com/" title="zb3k (Dmitriy Bourim) on deviantART">Dmitriy Bourim</a>, <a href="http://zb3k.deviantart.com/#/d2r6wei" title="Neon - bowtie theme v2 by ~zb3k on deviantART">Neon</a> is one of the best theme I’ve discovered so far. The round shaped glowing neon surrounding the album cover, also as song indicator, will fill up slowly as the song is being played. The song indicator doesn’t always work as expected though. The track I play from Rdio will finish sooner even though the indicator hasn’t reach the middle.</p>

<p>Unlike other themes, Neon requires a compatible wallpaper to make it glows beautifully. I find that dark wallpapers work well with Neon as you can see from screenshot above.</p>

<p>Bowtie can also show notification of playing song via Growl. I’ve covered some of the <a href="http://sayzlim.net/4-beautiful-dark-growl-styles-themes/" title="sayzlim.net: 4 Beautiful Dark Growl Styles Themes">perfect dark Growl themes</a> which you might find interesting.</p>
