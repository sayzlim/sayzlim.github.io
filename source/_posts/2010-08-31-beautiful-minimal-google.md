Google is a simple search engine. The site itself is minimal. But for you who love beautiful and simple user interface. Here you can check out [more details][1] covered by Beautiful Pixels.

I think you will love the [extensions I listed for Safari 5][2]. It has some jaw dropping interface tweaker extension.
