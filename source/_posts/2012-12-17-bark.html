  <p>Previous solutions to integrating Growl with Notification Center have involved forwarding all notifications, whether you wanted them or not. Others have everything appear as &#8220;Growl.&#8221; Not with Bark. We work around Apple&#8217;s limitations. Sonora is Sonora, just as it should be.</p>
