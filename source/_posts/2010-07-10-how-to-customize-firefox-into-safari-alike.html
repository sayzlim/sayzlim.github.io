<p>There are countless debate over which browser is the best. It is human nature to seek for the best, not to mention the best browser. If you&#8217;ve done some research, most of the people will vote for Firefox as the best browser. If you&#8217;re a new Mac user and prefer Firefox as your default browser but wish it looks more Safarish. Then keep reading on.</p>

<p>Customizing Firefox is easy to follow because of the simplicity of addons. The problem is you have to search and test many addons before you can achieve the result. So I&#8217;ll list most of the compatible addons here.</p>

<h3>Safari Theme for Firefox</h3>

<p>There are many themes that suppose to be like Safari, but the best theme I can find is GrApple Yummy. There are many versions of it and you may <a href="http://www.takebacktheweb.org/">take a look</a> before deciding which one suits your taste. I recommend GrApple Yummy as the theme.</p>

<h3>Safari Style Address Bar</h3>

<p>Do you see the progress displayed in the address bar? You can create that by <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1951/">using Fission addon</a>. Later on you can configure the color of the bar, but most of time you don&#8217;t need to configure the color since it automatically use the default color matched to Safari style.</p>

<h3>Top Sites Feature</h3>

<p>While I&#8217;m not the fans of the top sites feature, I think I need to include the alternative for Firefox user. If you like the top sites feature in Safari and wish there is one in Firefox. You can <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8879/">get it with Foxtab</a>. I can&#8217;t say this is the best addon since it is quite complicated during the configuration.</p>

<h3>View PDF inside Browser</h3>

<p>Firefox doesn&#8217;t have the capability to view PDF inside browser. So we&#8217;re going to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7518/">install some addons</a> to make it work.</p>

<h3>Clean Up Your Toolbar</h3>

<p>If you install some extra addons or Foxtab mentioned above, you&#8217;ll need to clean up some of the extra icons by going to view&#160;» toolbar&#160;» customize as seen below.</p>

<p>Then drag the icon you don&#8217;t want to appear to the where many icons listed. You can also do the same to add icon to toolbar.</p>

<p>If you encounter any problem (I hope not), feel free to leave comment or contact me.</p>
