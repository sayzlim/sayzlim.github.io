<a href="http://eggfreckles.net/notes/repair-disk-permissions/">Repair Disk Permissions Myth</a><br/><p>Thomas Brand addressed one of the most common myth on disk permissions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only time you need to run Repair Disk Permissions is if you changed a system-level permission you shouldn’t have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to stay up late searching for tools and tips to optimize Mac. I downloaded all the some recommended applications that claim to optimize and speed up OS X. I guess what they do are simply clearing caches and changing priority of the processes. It wasn’t a pleasant experience. I ended up staying awake whole night trying to revert its condition from <em>fast</em> to normal.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I let OS X manages everything. I’ve only <a href="http://sayzlim.net/post/58245260102" title="sayzlim.net: Speed Up Your Mac Drastically">adjusted some animations</a> to improve my experience.</p>

<p>Avoid needless hacks when OS X doesn’t freeze your Mac. Instead of spending your time to optimize OS X, try to come up with a way to finish your tasks efficiently.</p>
