<p>It’s not just stunning. It’s absolutely gorgeous. <a href="http://sophiestication.com/magicalweather/">Magical Weather</a> is crafted by Sophia Teutschler, a designer and iOS developer, who keep pushing many beautiful apps under her own brand <a href="http://sophiestication.com">Sophiestication</a>. Without doubt, Magical Weather carries the essential of “great design in simple app” that I can’t stop myself from not writing about it.</p>

<p>Weather Exposé displays your current location weather and allows you to add 8 more locations. Each Exposé will show the temperature and weather condition in front of the scenic images. Easily add location by city, zip code, or airport code.</p>

<p>Captivated by the animation that changes according the weather condition, the iPad on the side of desk has turned into a useful weather station.</p>

<p>Detailed weather information can be found by tapping on each Exposé. Weather Panel will show the atmospheric pressure, humidity, chance of rain, wind speed, and also UV index. Under the same panel, you can see the weather forecast for upcoming 6 days. You can easily hide the forecast by dragging the side panel down.</p>

<p>Drag the side panel and you can view today the temperature and chance of rain change measured in hour interval. Especially useful for someone like me who lives in a tropical country.</p>

<p>This gorgeous app is current on sale, and you can get it on your iPad for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magical-weather/id396179545?mt=8">$0.99</a>.</p>
