<p>Safari is becoming more beautiful with the support from several top notch extensions. Most of the extensions I install on Safari are interface tweaker. It literally means that none of them are heavy to your browser experience because they only override the CSS. You don&#8217;t need to install all of them, so take your pick only the sites you visit regularly.</p>

<h3>Feather for New Twitter</h3>

<p>The first sight of #NewTwitter is beautiful compared to its predecessor. Eventually I feel overwhelmed by the new interface. This extension will clear all the clutter and things you don&#8217;t like. I have to say that this is one of my favorite extension.</p>

<h3>Pure Reader for Google Reader</h3>

<p>There are several extensions that modify Google Reader. Some of the like Snow Leopard for Google Reader does a great job until I discover Pure Reader. Both extensions do a great job in providing minimalist interface. But I prefer Pure Reader purely because its clean interface and icons.</p>

<h3>Beautipedia for Wikipedia</h3>

<p>For most of the students, copy and paste from Wikipedia is a common task (admit it). Beautipedia tweak Wikipedia interface from good to very good. If you are one of the people who prefer cleaner interface, this extension will is highly recommended.</p>

<h3>MacRumorsMinimal</h3>

<p>The first impression when I visit macrumors is how not my taste their interface is. This extension will get rid the forum-like interface and turn in into blog-like interface.</p>

<h3>MacThemes Clean</h3>

<p>For most of the OS X user, MacThemes is probably their favorite place for getting beautiful wallpapers and icons for free. Of course you will expect one of their user to create an extension that modify the site itself.</p>

<h3>Instapaper Greystyled</h3>

<p>Instapaper default design is enough for me. But if you&#8217;re looking for alternative inteface. Considering Instapaper Greystyled for a different UX.</p>
