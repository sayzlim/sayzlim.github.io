The world of software development is full of people who build and share their creation for free. It’s no longer valid to dismiss free products as useless — most of the services you use online these days are free. Here are five apps I deem as useful for Mac users.

## BetterTouchTool
Turn gestures into shortcuts. You can assign shortcuts for most of the input devices: Magic Mouse, Trackpad, Keyboard, Apple Remote, and Leap Motion. I mostly use BetterTouchTool for [common shortcuts while browsing in Safari](http://brettterpstra.com/2013/06/06/just-some-bettertouchtool-notes/ "Just some BetterTouchTool notes - BrettTerpstra.com").

For starter, I suggest to [use BetterTouchTool to manage your windows](http://sayzlim.net/bettertouchtool-windows-management "BetterTouchTool for Windows Management - Sayz Lim").

## Houdini
Houdini is my favorite. It does only one thing: [hide away inactive apps](http://sayzlim.net/reason-hide-inactive-apps "Reason to Hide Away Inactive Apps - Sayz Lim"). Everything about it are great, the icon, the user interface, and the user experience. You should download Houdini if you find your screen is always full of inactive windows.

## NameChanger
Rename the list of files quickly and easily with NameChanger. There is always a free alternative for the tasks you want to do, but free usually comes with a flaw of being unsuable. NameChanger is easy to use without any configurations. Just drop the files you want to rename in the box and use the existing options to rename files. It also supports regular expression for more complicated renaming rules.

## SnappyApp

I’ve reviewed SnappyApp before in one of the post. This app basically create a sticky screenshot on your Mac. Use it to compare image side by side, or use it to stick temporary notes.

## Tagger

Another useful app to manage MP3 tag. I mainly use it to batch edit the information for the songs I store in iTunes. Sometimes the changes I made in iTunes is not reflected no matter how many times I apply. By using Tagger the change immediately appear. You can also use it search to find artwork and the album information from the [VGMdb](http://vgmdb.net/ "VGMdb: Video Game Music and Anime Soundtrack Database").
