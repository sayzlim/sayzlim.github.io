<p>Talking about perfection, there is one thing about Snow Leopard — I&#8217;m not sure about other version — that keeps bothering me. With the dock hidden, I expect the maximized window will cover entire screen perfectly, which unfortunately doesn&#8217;t do its job well. It leaves a 3–4 pixel gaps at the bottom of the hidden dock.</p>

<p>After some research and the solution discovery process, it turns out that  the bottom hidden dock reserves 3 pixels — as the matter of fact I don&#8217;t know what it does.</p>

<p>Not giving up, I move the dock to the left screen edge and try to maximize the window again (I used Cinch to maximize the window), and the gap is still there.</p>

<p>I have tested several applications, starting from Cinch, FlexiGlass, Divvy, and SizeUp, which yield a similar result. I started to believe that there is no way to fill the gap, until I discovered BetterTouchTool.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.boastr.de/">BetterTouchTool</a> is a lightweight app designed by <a href="http://twitter.com/boastr_net">Andreas Hegenberg</a> that add multiple shortcut ability to your trackpad and mouse devices. Alongside with these features, you can enable snapping features similar to the apps listed above.</p>

<p>Unlike other apps, BetterTouchTool can fill the whole screen if the dock is located on either side of the screen. I&#8217;m not going to write a lengthy article about BetterTouchTool right now <sup id="fnref:p5183547740-1"><a href="#fn:p5183547740-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but I will let you know how I can configure the behavior of the snapping feature.</p>
