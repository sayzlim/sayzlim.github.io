<p>If you&#8217;ve been following my blog since the beginning of it. You will realize that I rarely review an app.<sup id="fnref:p4750652136-1"><a href="#fn:p4750652136-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> There are too many well written review articles out there. I am not one of those writers. I&#8217;m too good for these kinds of articles.<sup id="fnref:p4750652136-2"><a href="#fn:p4750652136-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a Tweetie fans for so long that I don&#8217;t remember since when I started using it. Tweetie is a great app. However, it lacks some features I need. For instance, the ability to unfavorite a tweet.</p>

<p>Back to Twitterrific 4 for Mac. This app caught my attention recently because I saw a compact version on their website. It actually looks better than I thought.</p>

<p>The first time I launch the app, I&#8217;m so sure I will replace Ollie <sup id="fnref:p4750652136-3"><a href="#fn:p4750652136-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> entirely. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like her, she just doesn&#8217;t fit well with his mates on the dock.</p>

<p>I setup my account and started to configure it to fit my needs. Some of the settings are very clear while some of them are ambiguous. I need to google how the Auto Refresh works, which actually show the interval between each refresh in seconds, before configuring it.</p>

<p>I prefer dark theme and there is no need for notification sound. Keep timeline on top is also unnecessary.</p>

<p>If you have large number of active followers. You better switch off &#8220;Show Mentions from Everyone&#8221; to cut down the distraction on your main timeline.</p>

<ul><li>Show for Mentions - Check</li>
<li>Show for Messages - Check</li>
<li>Show in Menubar - Check</li>
<li>Show in Dock - Check</li>
</ul><p>Finally, toggle the toolbar and sidebar from the window menu. Now I get the Twitterrific I want.</p>

<p>Learn the shortcuts and it becomes one of the apps I love. I can&#8217;t say that <a href="http://twitterrific.com/mac">Twitterrific</a> is perfect and suitable for everyone. But if you are the casual user who loves simple app and doesn&#8217;t mind navigating finder to upload your picture. Twitterrific is one of them.</p>

<p>Ollie is the mascot of Twitterrific. I don&#8217;t know if it is he/she. But she is better off with &#8220;she&#8221;. <a href="#fnref:p4750652136-3" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
