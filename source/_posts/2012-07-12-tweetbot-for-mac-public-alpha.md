The great folks over Tapbots has released the public alpha of Tweetbot for Mac. I don’t really have much interest in reviewing it. Not until it hits official release. Although it’s alpha version, you can use it for without problems.

If you’ve been wondering which Twitter client to get on OS X. This is the right time to get a taste of Tweetbot.
