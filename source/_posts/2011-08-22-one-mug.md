Washing dishes is one of my favorite activity. Although I like washing dishes, it doesn’t mean I love to see the pile of dishes especially cups and mugs.

I have this one simple rule for my family and me.[^1] Each of the family member only has their own mugs. If you want to use it, you have to wash it. If you don’t wash it, don’t drink.

Prepare a separate set of utensils for guests. Also prepare a set of utensils for family. This simple rule can help you remove unnecessary utensils and cut down the needs to wash dishes.

1.  As for now, I’m the only one abiding this rule.
