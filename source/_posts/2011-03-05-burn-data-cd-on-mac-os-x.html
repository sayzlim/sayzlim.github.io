<p>Burning data CD on Mac OSX doesn&#8217;t require third party application and can be done easily. The built in ability to burn data CD can be accessed by right clicking on the files or folders.</p>

<p>You can select multiples folders to burn them into disc or you can put the folders you want to burn into one folder and burn the selected folder. The latter will not create root folder. Instead, it will only burn the folders and files within it.</p>
