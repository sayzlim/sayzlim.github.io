<p>If you are like me, someone who is always looking at the Activity Monitor to find out what is running, then there is high chance you know what is running.</p>

<p>What if you don&#8217;t know what is running? Sometimes I wonder what process should be running and which one is the redundant one. When you install an apps, there is a chance it will run additional plugin or process without your knowing. So what you need to know what is the default processes that every OS X running.</p>

<p>Take a look at the image below. It shows you the default processes if you don&#8217;t run any apps except connected to Internet. Let&#8217;s take a look at each process. And, I&#8217;m going to explain in human language. :-)</p>
