<p>People who know me will find that I am Apple maniac. True indeed, I love most (if not all) of Apple products. But, I wasn&#8217;t born like this. There is some short story before I come to get know Apple products.</p>

<p>I remembered back then 2 years ago when I first started to learn about computer. Everything was fascinating, I was given the chance to use notebook in the office at night since I didn&#8217;t have my own. And during that time, I only knew that computer is Windows.</p>

<p>So, I learned my way around Windows. I used a lot of software to optimise Windows. Windows XP was still in its glory era. I even got myself a handbook to tweak the registry just to increase the performance. And it was likely several times the notebook need to be formatted.</p>

<p>And&#8230; something amazing happenedâ€¦</p>

<p>One of my friend brought his shiny elegant MacBook White to our class. I was really fascinated. It was really the first time I could actually see and use it. And the first question from me was &#8220;How much does it cost?&#8221;. For someone like me who were just a normal college student with no income, moreover living in Indonesia. Buying MacBook was my first goal that I must achieve. And the MacBook White during that time is around 13 million rupiah or around 1400 USD.</p>

<p>MacBook back then was a very expensive product and only some people were able to purchase one. Geeks like me wanted a fast computer. But after that stunning experience, I wanted both beautiful and fast computer. Other brand that came into my mind was Sony Vaio. Apple did that.</p>

<p>It took me a year to work and save in order to buy the MacBook I am currently using to type this post. It might be one of the best money I have spent in these years.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know about you. But I love how I don&#8217;t need to be bothered fixing registry. I love how I don&#8217;t need to install 3rd party plugin to get my works done. I love how I don&#8217;t need to install driver just to get the display works.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if Apple is going to be like that forever. But I&#8217;m sure that as long Steve Jobs stay in the company, this love for their products would never change.</p>

<p>And while you are at it, why don&#8217;t you read this <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/john-sculley-on-steve-jobs-the-full-interview-transcript/63295">interview with the former Apple CEO</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, I will be very glad to talk to you on <a href="http://twitter.com/sayzlim">Twitter</a> if you are also an Apple fan.</p>
