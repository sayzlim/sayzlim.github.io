There are millions of gorgeous wallpapers available online, but only a few screen savers that actually look great on Mac. Among the screen savers I’ve tried, these are the most beautiful screen savers you can install on your Mac — Adobe Flash Plugin is not required.

## Nibbble

[Nibbble](http://uglyapps.co.uk/nibbble/ "Nibbble — A Dribbble screensaver for OS X - UglyApps") pulls the most popular shots from Dribbble, a website for designers to show their best works, and displays them in the grid system as screen saver. Let Nibbble becomes the source of inspiration whenever you’re idling and unable to draw a single line on your Mac. Seriously, it looks damn great on large screen.

## Fliqlo

[Fliqlo](http://fliqlo.com/ "Fliqlo - Flip Clock Screensaver")  is a flip clock style screen saver that takes the ambience of your room up to another level. It used to be my favorite screen saver until I decided to remove Adobe Flash Plugin, rendering this clock unusable.

The good news is the the maker of Fliqlo has rebuilt the screen saver from scratch with CSS.  Adobe Flash Plugin is no longer a requirement and that’s going to save a lot of battery.

## Screenstagram

Instagram is a perfect example of social network made for visual people. It lets  the users to communicate with picture.

If you follow people who take amazing pictures on Instagram, you’ll love to have these pictures as your screensaver. [Screenstagram](http://screenstagram.s3.amazonaws.com/download.html "Screenstagram version 2.01") lets you login with your Instagram account and display those images in the grid layout similar to Nibbble. There is an option to show only the photos you’ve favorited, or you can also exclude tags you’re not interested.

## Padbury Clock

[Padbury Clock](http://www.padbury.me/clock/ "Padbury Clock — A Screen Saver for OS X") shares the same design vibe as iOS 7 and upcoming OS X Yosemite — thin line, smooth curve, and sans-serif typeface. The modern Swiss Style clock screen saver is a perfect match for small screen laptop like MacBook Air. It’s also the one I’m using now.

## iOS Screen Saver

Sometimes we just love to bring what we have on OS X to iOS, and vice versa. [iOS Screen Saver](http://bodysoulspirit.weebly.com/ios-screensaver.html "iOS Screensaver - Bodysoulspirit") comes with the default iOS 7 lock screen wallpaper, but you can change it with your favorite wallpaper.

You can configure the screen saver for different type of screen size. Change the font size, the date format, and the position of each element. Talk about the uniform style, this is the one you’re going to use if you often put Mac, iPhone, and iPad side by side.
