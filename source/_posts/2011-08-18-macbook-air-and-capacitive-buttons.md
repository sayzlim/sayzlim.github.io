[Keyboardless MacBook Air][1], no physical buttons. I’ve seriously considered the fact without physical click to provide feedbacks, it can be a painful experience.

Of course, that’s not all.

Unless you use your Mac without looking at the screen. The feedback you expect is not from the physical touch on the keyboard buttons. Instead, you expect the feedbacks from the screen.

The only feedback you expect from capacitive buttons is from screen. Therefore, implementing capacitive buttons as a keyboard is highly implementable.

And, the article is targeting phone in general. Therefore, capacitive buttons might works in some devices.[^2]
