> I was working out on the gym and someone let the weights fall to the floor. It made a sound that reminded me of small arms fire and I dived to the ground. I don’t know why but I did. Sometimes it happens.

> The guy began laughing and when I told him to please stop it, that it wasn’t funny, he asked why. I explained. He then said: You all soldiers are fucking crazy. Get a life!

There is a reason why I tell my sister not to judge. We don’t know the story behind each person behavior. They don’t know our story, and we don’t know their story. That’s why we need to develop patience and compassion towards each other.
