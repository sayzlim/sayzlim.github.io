description: Complete list of apps I’ve installed on my MacBook Air.
---
Each person has their own set of tools to get jobs done. This is the list of the apps I’m using everyday. Some of the apps are not available on App Store, so you need to buy directly from the developers. Links from App Store are affiliate links.

## Essential on Mac
Those are the apps I must install on my Mac. Without these apps, I’ll have hard time navigating from one screen to another.

- Alfred (£17): [App Store][3] or [Direct][4]
- BetterTouchTool (Free): [Direct][5]
- DragonDrop ($4.99): [App Store][6]

## System Preferences
Those apps are installed within System Preferences. FunctionFlip is useful if you only want to enable part of the function keys. Magic Launch allows you to set rules which files should open with which apps. SmoothMouse fix the quirk of OS X mouse cursor delay. Hazel? That’s one of the most powerful app you can get on Mac.
