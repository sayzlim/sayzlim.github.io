I publish all my posts on Tumblr because of its simplicity. It’s a blogging platform where you just write. It’s a place where many authors with credibility share their thought. It’s a social network where readers can get know their favorite writers.

### Beautiful and Useful
I believe in beautiful computing experience. I want to show people that they can do everything they’ve been doing efficiently while keeping the desktop clean. I want to show that they can have a beautiful designed computer with well arranged workspace. This is the idea. It’s about beautiful desktop, icons, and animations.

To tell a story I want to tell. To write a story I want people to read. Below are some of the stories I’ve written:
