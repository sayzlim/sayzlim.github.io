I used to publish [all my posts on Tumblr](http://sayzlim.tumblr.com) because of its simplicity. It’s a blogging platform where you just write. It’s a place where many authors with credibility share their thoughts. It’s a social network where readers can get know their favorite writers.

Right now I publish with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "Octopress"). The setup is straightforward and the generated sites is fast. I hope you find this site more useful after the migration.

### Beautiful and Useful
I believe in beautiful computing experience. I want to show people that they can do everything they’ve been doing efficiently while keeping the desktop clean. I want to show that they can have a beautiful designed computer with well arranged workspace. This is the idea. It’s about beautiful desktop, icons, and animations.

To tell a story I want to tell. To write a story I want people to read. Below are some of the stories I’ve written:

- [The Most Beautiful Folder Icons Replacement for Mac][1]
- [Clean Your Menu Bar, Sweeten Download Stack][2]
- [Three Extensions, One Browser, Killed Flash][3]
- [Simplify Your iTunes Library][4]
