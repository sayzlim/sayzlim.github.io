I used to publish [all my posts on Tumblr][5110-001] because of its simplicity. It’s a blogging platform where you just write. It’s a place where many authors with credibility share their thoughts. It’s a social network where readers can get know their favorite writers.

Right now I publish with [Octopress][5110-002]. The setup is straightforward and the generated sites is fast. I hope you find this site more useful after the migration.

### Organize, Minimize, and Focus
The core of this blog is to organize your digital life — your photos, notes, or videos.  At the same time, organizing shouldn’t take up your precious time. That’s why creating a workflow  is important to minimize the works. Effective workflows can yield more time. That’s where we spend the time to focus on the 20%, the important tasks. You can find out how I minimize my works from these posts:
