This membership page is tucked away in the footer because I’m sure only a few would pay attention to it. Let me make a humble request since you’ve visited this page.

I want fully work on this site and one of the way to achieve that is by receiving the direct support from readers like you. You can do so by **subscribing to this site for $2 a month**.

<form class="paypal" action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick">
<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="E2ZSD9VF7X8FL">
<input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_subscribeCC_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!">

</form>

I’m not going to compare $2 to a cup of coffee because I know $2 is a big deal. It represents the time you spent to earn your monthly income. 

Don’t worry, even without this subscription, I’ll keep writing. I simply have to provide more value so you can spend that $2 next time on the book I write or the service I provide.
