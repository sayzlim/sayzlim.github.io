# The Comprehensive Guide to Decluttering Digital Shelf

Are you frowning whenever you look at the messy documents, passwords, and photos library? You shouldn’t let these items bother you. Take control and keep them organized.

By nature, we prefer an environment where we can stay focus on the tasks in hand. You don’t find this type of environment. You build it. Being a minimalist means to seek for the “just enough” working environment without being over-concerned with your tools.

You choose to organize and remove your items because you want to keep the distraction level low and the journey to enter the flow short. If you have trouble remembering the password you’ve created, or take a long time searching for the photos you’ve taken, it means you spend energy on mundane tasks.

The value of staying organized is to pave the way for you to search information and draw a meaningful insights in the most efficient way.

## The guides is for you, if you want to…

- Secure your passwords and keep the accessible from everywhere.
- Organize and backup photos without relying on third-party apps.
- Store notes in the way that can accommodate any kinds of usage.
