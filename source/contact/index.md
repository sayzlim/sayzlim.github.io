My name is Sutanto, but I’m known as Sayz Lim online. I avoid using my real name because it’s a common name in Indonesia, and I  prefer to have the same username for all my online accounts.

I currently live in Batam, Indonesia with my younger sister and mother.

I’ve been a contributor for the largest Apple News Portal in Indonesia, [MakeMac](http://www.makemac.com/ "MakeMac: Situs Tips, Tutorial, Review dan Berita Apple Terbesar di Indonesia"), since 2011 and acted as Editor-in-chief starting 2012–2013. I quit my position as Editor-in-chief in early 2013 and continue to help with SEO and SEM for the mother company, Apps Foundry.
