My name is Sutanto, but most people know me as Sayz Lim. I’ve been writing about technology, mostly about OS X and iOS, on this site since 2010 to help people simplify their workflows while working on a Mac.

I’m a firm believer that technology is made to create more free time for us so we can pursue the creative side of our works. The tools are made to amplify our output with the least amount of efforts as possible.

I publish on this site every Wednesday and Friday, and send an exclusive article through newsletter every Sunday. Just enter your email below to subscribe:

<div class="subscribe-page">

    <form class="form subscribe" action="http://sayzlim.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe/post" method="POST">

      <input type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="email" placeholder="Email Address" required>
      <input type="submit" class="subscribe" value="Sign Up">
    </form>
