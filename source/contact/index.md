My name is Sutanto, but I’m known as Sayz Lim online. I avoid using my real name because it’s common in Indonesia, and I  prefer to have the same username for all my online accounts.

I currently live in Batam, Indonesia with my younger sister and mother.

I’ve been a contributor for the largest Apple News Portal in Indonesia, [MakeMac](http://www.makemac.com/ "MakeMac: Situs Tips, Tutorial, Review dan Berita Apple Terbesar di Indonesia"), since 2011 and acted as Editor-in-chief starting 2012–2013. I quit my position as Editor-in-chief in early 2013 and continue to help with SEO and SEM for the mother company, Apps Foundry.

I start writing regularly on this site late 2013 and plan to turn this my full time job. One day, I’ll request the support from the readers like you, but for now, I’ll focus in improving my writing until that day arrives.
