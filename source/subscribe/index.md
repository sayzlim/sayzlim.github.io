There can only be two reasons if you want to subscribe. Either you want a simple way to organize digital life, or you want a better computing experience. [Most of my posts](http://sayzlim.net/start "Start - Sayz Lim") are written with those two goals as the foundation.

Receive an email update whenever new article is published:

<form class="form subscribe" action="http://sayzlim.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe/post" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="u" value="ff1398bcc911abf87a3dfe82d">
  <input type="hidden" name="id" value="cc23ae2e4d">
  <input type="text" value="" name="FNAME" class="name" placeholder="First Name" required>
  <input type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="email" placeholder="Email Address" required>
  <input type="submit" class="subscribe" value="Go">
</form>
