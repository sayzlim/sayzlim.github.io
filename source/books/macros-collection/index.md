# Practical Example of Macros to Become Keyboard Maestro

What can you do after you’ve bought Keyboard Maestro? You definitely want to use it to automate everything that can be automated. The point is you want to save time!

Learning by example is the most practical way to learn new things. Keyboard Maestro itself has a lot of actions that requires decent amount of time to master, and this book doesn’t try to teach you everything all at once. Instead, I’m going to show you some example of macros you can immediately use in your workflows.

What makes learning by example so effective is you only learn a chunk of skill at a time, and eventually learn more as you need to create more complex macros.
