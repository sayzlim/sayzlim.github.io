The “Histories” notebook shows 2651 notes saved — 220 notes a month, 7 notes a day. Here is what it looks like inside this notebook.</p><p>I saved my first note on November 20, 2013. It’s a <a href="https://distilleryimage9.s3.amazonaws.com/fb8d9c7c4dee11e3b2cd128ee1f40433_8.jpg" title="Tae Yeon">photo of a Korean artist</a> I’ve favorited on Instagram. Looking back into the first month, I was active on Twitter. I see a lot of favorites and retweets. I should be spending most of the time reading and writing, but I discovered half of the notes are from Twitter and Tumblr.</p><p>It’s fascinating to look back at what you’ve done on an exact day. Which article did I read? What tweet did post on Twitter? What status message did I share on Facebook?</p><p><a href="https://images.sayzlim.net/2014/12/evernote_mention.jpg" title="Search Favorited Mentions in Evernote"> <img src="https://images.sayzlim.net/2014/12/evernote_mention.jpg" alt="Search Favorited Mentions in Evernote" title="Search Favorited Mentions in Evernote" /> </a></p><p><strong>The Histories Notebook</strong> has become a valuable resources in my workflow. It has saved me a lot of trouble whenever I need to refer to tweets I’ve posted or articles I’ve read. Recently I need to search for one of the tweets I’ve favorited for Word Counter review. The only thing I remember is the author of the tweet. What I did was simple. I entered “@ctietze” into the search menu and the results shows me tweets containing the search term. That saved me the hassle to scroll through author timeline or using the advanced Twitter search which considerably requires more time compared to a few seconds I spent in Evernote.</p><p><a href="https://images.sayzlim.net/2014/12/evernote_productivity.jpg" title="Search for Archived Articles in Evernote"> <img src="https://images.sayzlim.net/2014/12/evernote_productivity.jpg" alt="Search for Archived Articles in Evernote" title="Search for Archived Articles in Evernote" /> </a></p><p>Sometimes you want to quote one of the articles you’ve read in your writing or presentation. Finding them is easy if you’ve archived them in Evernote. For example, I can search for notes containing “productivity” that are tagged with Instapaper to view articles related to productivity. With the addition of <a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2014/10/02/context-work-enriched-smartest-minds/" title="Context: Your Work Enriched by the Smartest Minds - Evernote Blog">Evernote Contexts</a>, related notes are available at the bottom of the notes, making the process of finding similar notes much faster.</p><p>This notebook also helps me keep track of the events that attracted my attention. You can remember when and where met someone, or which conferences you gave a talk.</p><p>If you’ve kept up to this paragraph, I’m sure you want to create a new notebook to keep track of what you’ve done. Name it as Histories, Records, or Journals. Here is the list of IFTTT recipes I use in my Histories Notebook to help you getting started.</p><h2 id="shared-ifttt-channels">Shared IFTTT Channels</h2><p>The most important thing when keeping a Histories Notebook is to automate. You don’t want to spend time creating notes in this notebook. Most of the common channels are available on IFTTT so you can turn on the channels you want to track, and create more recipes for your own needs.</p><h3 id="twitter">Twitter</h3><p>I choose to save only new tweets, favorited tweets, and retweets. The point I want to make with Twitter is I want to know what I’ve said, and what kind of contents that have caught my attention. Retweets is an agreement with what the poster have shared — it’s the original way to use Twitter by spreading the message to your followers. I avoid saving direct messages and mentions as it’s made for conversation. If you find mention worth saving, just hit the favorite button to have it sent to Evernote.</p><ul><li><a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/130586-send-posted-tweets-including-retweets-to-evernote" title="Send Posted Tweets, Including Retweets, to Evernote">Send Posted Tweets, Including Retweets, to Evernote</a><li><a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/228745-send-favorited-tweets-to-evernote" title="Send Favorited Tweets to Evernote">Send Favorited Tweets to Evernote</a></ul><h3 id="facebook">Facebook</h3><p>Facebook is the least used channel in the list, but some of you might use it to connect with friends.

This is the concept I introduced in <a href="https://sayzlim.net/read-later-zero" title="Read Later Zero - Sayz Lim">Read Later Zero</a>: build up reading list buffer, but ruthlessly eliminate boring articles. By archiving the articles you’ve read, you can make sure that the Histories Notebook is free from unread articles.</p><ul><li><a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/130589-send-archived-articles-on-pocket-to-evernote" title="Send Archived Items on Pocket to Evernote">Send Archived Items on Pocket to Evernote</a><li><a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/228755-send-archived-items-on-instapaper-to-evernote" title="Send Archived Items on Instapaper to Evernote">Send Archived Items on Instapaper to Evernote</a></ul><h3 id="instagram">Instagram</h3><p>Photos.

I might pull a quote from one of the articles I’ve read. I might tell a story with one of the photos I’ve taken. But journal is where I’m being honest with myself, a kid roaming around without parent surveillance, a character in Grand Theft Auto that rampages over the city, or a star in this expanding space. I’m naked in the journal.</p><p>Meanwhile, Histories Notebook records what I’ve said, which articles I’ve read, and where I’ve gone. It shows the taken path, and you can only see those path if you start recording them now.</p></article></section><aside class="related-posts"><h5>Related Posts</h5><div class="related-box"><div class="related-card"><div class="related-date">Mar 16, 2021</div><a href="/evernote-device-limit-workaround/"><div class="related-title">Evernote Device Limit Workaround</div><div class="related-desc">Find out how you can turn the Evernote website into an application to work around the device limit.</div></a><ul class="excerpt-tags"><li><a href="/tag/evernote">Evernote</a><li><a href="/tag/tutorial">Tutorial</a></ul></div><div class="related-card"><div class="related-date">Jun 03, 2016</div><a href="/hazel-save-bills-evernote/"><div class="related-title">How to Use Hazel to Save Bills to Evernote Automatically</div><div class="related-desc">Why are you still saving invoices and receipts to Evernote manually if you can archive them automatically with Hazel?</div></a><ul class="excerpt-tags"><li><a href="/tag/hazel">Hazel</a><li><a href="/tag/evernote">Evernote</a><li><a href="/tag/ifttt">IFTTT</a><li><a href="/tag/dropbox">Dropbox</a></ul></div><div class="related-card"><div class="related-date">Dec 23, 2014</div><a href="/evernote-workflows/"><div class="related-title">Evernote Workflows</div><div class="related-desc">Evernote is essential in my workflow, and with workflows I can customize how I want the note created easily from Safari and iBooks.</div></a><ul class="excerpt-tags"><li><a href="/tag/evernote">Evernote</a><li><a href="/tag/workflow">Workflow</a></ul></div><div class="related-card"><div class="related-date">Nov 01, 2014</div><a href="/evernote-search-alfred-workflow/"><div class="related-title">Evernote Search Alfred Workflow</div><div class="related-desc">Evernote Search is a simple Alfred workflow that searches for Evernote’s notes quickly by using Spotlight indexes.</div></a><ul class="excerpt-tags"><li><a href="/tag/evernote">Evernote</a><li><a href="/tag/alfred">Alfred</a></ul></div></div></aside></main><aside class="sidebar"><div class="sticky-box"> <form class="form" action="https://app.convertkit.com/forms/2056450/subscriptions" method="post" data-sv-form="2056450" data-uid="c249fe0755" data-options="{&quot;settings&quot;:{&quot;after_subscribe&quot;:{&quot;action&quot;: &quot;redirect&quot;,&quot;redirect_url&quot;: &quot;https://sayzlim.net/welcome/&quot;}}}"> <label for="name">First Name</label> <input type="text" value="" name="fields[first_name]" placeholder="First Name" id="name" required> <label for="email">Email</label> <input type="email" value="" name="email_address" placeholder="Email Address" id="email" required> <button class="subscribe">Subscribe</button> </form><div class="sidebar-promo form"><p>Download CleanMyMac X, CleanShot X, and ClearVPN and other 30++ macOS applications for only $9.99/month.<br><a href="/is-setapp-worth-it/">Read More</a></p></div><div class="carbon-box"> <script async src="//cdn.carbonads.com/carbon.js?serve=CKYIC2JI" id="_carbonads_js"></script></div></div></aside><footer class="footer"> &copy; 2010–2021 Sayz Lim | Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a></footer></div>
